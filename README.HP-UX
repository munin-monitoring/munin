There is a somewhat ragged set of contributed HP-UX specific plugins
requiering various licenses.  We hope for further contributions to
make the HP-UX support more complete.

Please note that Makefile.config needs editing almost at the very end
to work, the sections are commented.

You will also need GNU Make which you can find here:

Europe: http://hpux.asknet.de/hppd/hpux/Gnu/make-3.81/
US and other places: http://hpux.cs.utah.edu/hppd/hpux/Gnu/make-3.81/

Many thanks to Ralph Grothe for the contributions towards HP-UX support.
