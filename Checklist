This is a pre-release checklist for the maintainer.

 * is there any "FIX" in: ChangeLog, INSTALL, Announce?

 * Is .htaccess installed?
 * rm -f /etc/munin/plugins/* 
      Does munin-node-configure -d show any autoconf errors?
      Does munin-node-configure --debug run nicely or do we get perl errors?

 * Update plugins/plugins.history.in:

   1. cd plugins

   2. Figure out which r the previous tag was at and do this (r910 was
	  1.3.2 and r1234 is head)
      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A | 
         cut -d/ -f 4- | sed 's/^node\.d\.//'

   3. Check if the listed plugins are still present (or moved):

      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A |
          cut -d/ -f 4- | sed s'/(.*//' | xargs ls -ld >/dev/null


# Git release

  The tag used here is "2.0.1", exchange this with a current version.

 * Update ChangeLog

   new="2.0.1"; old=$(git describe --abbrev=0)
   header=$(printf '\nmunin-%s, %s\n%s' "$new" "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" "$(sed -n 4,14p ChangeLog)")
   shortlog=$(git log --pretty=short --no-merges "${old}.." | git shortlog)
   printf "%s\n\n%s\n\n" "$header" "$shortlog" | sed -i "1r /dev/stdin" ChangeLog

 * Commit the updated changelog and tag this release

   git commit -m "$new" -- ChangeLog
   git tag -s "$new" -m "$new"

# Make tarball from tag

  git checkout 2.0.1
  make tar
  OR
  make tar-signed

# Propaganda

 * Broadcast the good news:
   1. Upload the release tar and signature:
      make tar-upload
   2. Update our website
   3. Send an email to the ML
   4. Update the version in the topic of the IRC channel
