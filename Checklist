This is a pre-release checklist for the maintainer.

 * is there any "FIX" in: ChangeLog, INSTALL, Announce?

 * Is .htaccess installed?
 * rm -f /etc/munin/plugins/* 
      Does munin-node-configure -d show any autoconf errors?
      Does munin-node-configure --debug run nicely or do we get perl errors?

 * Update plugins/plugins.history.in:

   1. cd plugins

   2. Figure out which r the previous tag was at and do this (r910 was
	  1.3.2 and r1234 is head)
      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A | 
         cut -d/ -f 4- | sed 's/^node\.d\.//'

   3. Check if the listed plugins are still present (or moved):

      svn --verbose log -r910:1234 | fgrep node.d | grep -w A |
          cut -d/ -f 4- | sed s'/(.*//' | xargs ls -ld >/dev/null


# Git release

  We follow the workflow documented at
  http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

  The tag used here is "2.0.1", exchange this with a current version.

 * Create release branch from "devel"

   git checkout -b release-2.0.1 devel

 * Update ChangeLog

   $EDITOR Changelog
   git commit -m 'Update changelog for release' -- ChangeLog

 * Merge release branch to master

   git checkout master
   git merge --no-ff release-2.0.1

   (handle any conflicts, and "git commit" the result)

 * Tag on master

   git tag -a -s -m 'Release 2.0.1' 2.0.1 master

 * Merge the release branch back to devel

  git checkout devel
  git merge --no-ff release-2.0.1

# Make tarball from tag

  git checkout 2.0.1
  make tar

# Propaganda

 * Broadcast the good news:
   1. make a sha256sum : sha256sum munin-version.tar.gz > munin-version.tar.gz.sha256sum
      and sign it using gpg.
   2. Upload the tar.gz on sourceforge.net
   3. Create a news on sf announcing it
   4. Update our front page
   5. Create a new release on freshmeat.net 
   6. Send an email to the ML
