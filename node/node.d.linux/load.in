# If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on wether we
# should be run on this system or not. This is optinal, and only used by
# munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
# always be included.

if [ "$1" = "autoconf" ]; then

# If run with the "config"-parameter, give out information on how the
# graphs should look.

	# one machine answer for several)

	# The title of the graph
	echo 'graph_title Load average'
	# Arguments to "rrdtool graph". In this case, tell it that the
	# lower limit of the graph is '0', and that 1k=1000 (not 1024)
	echo 'graph_args --base 1000 -l 0'
	# The Y-axis label
	echo 'graph_vlabel load'
	# We want Cur/Min/Avg/Max unscaled (i.e. 0.42 load instead of
	# 420 milliload)

	# Graph category. Defaults to 'other'
	echo 'graph_category system'
	# The fields. "label" is used in the legend. "label" is the only
	# required subfield. 
	echo 'load.label load'
	# These two are optional. They are only used if you have
	# configured your munin to tell a Nagios-server about any
	# problems
	echo 'load.warning 10'
	echo 'load.critical 120'
	# This one is purely to add an explanation to the web page. The first
	# one is for the graph itself, while the second one is for the field
	# "load".

	# display any data)
	exit 0
fi

# If not run with any parameters at all (or only unknown ones), do the
# real work - i.e. display the data. Almost always this will be
# "value" subfield for every data field.

# How could this plugin have been written in its simplest form?
# Something like this:
#
# ---------------------
# #!/bin/sh

#
# if [ "$1" = "config" ]; then

# 	echo "graph_title Load average"
#	echo 'graph_args --base 1000 -l 0'
#	echo 'graph_vlabel load'
# 	echo "load.label load"
# 	exit 0
# fi
# echo -n "load.value "
# cut -f1 -d' ' < /proc/loadavg
# ---------------------
#
# Except for the Nagios-warnings (which most people don't have any need
# for) and things used by installation scripts and munin-config (which
# you don't need if you don't plan on submitting your plugin to the
# pacakge), and the scaling (no milliload numbers) the two versions will
# work identically.
