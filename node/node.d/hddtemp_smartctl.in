#
# Plugin to monitor harddrive temperatures through SMART.
#
# client-conf.d/-options:
#
#	smartctl	-- path to smartctl executable
#	drives		-- List drives to monitor. E.g. "env.drives hda hdc".
#	type_$dev	-- device type for one drive, e.g. "env.type_sda 3ware,0"
#	args_$dev	-- additional arguments to smartctl for one drive,
#			   e.g. "env.args_hda -v 194,10xCelsius"
#                          Use this to make the plugin use the --all or -a option
#                          if your disk will not return it's temperature when
#                          only the -A option is used.
#	dev_$dev	-- monitoring device for one drive, e.g. twe0
#
# Note for users of RAID controllers (smartmontools currently only
# supports 3ware): you can specify the drives attached to your RAID
# controller(s) as raiddev_num (e.g. sda_0). Then you must specify the
# type like this: type_sda_0 3ware,0.
#
# Recent versions of the kernel driver use a separate major device number
# for monitoring purposes, like /dev/twe<n> or /dev/twa<n>. This can be
# put in the e.g. dev_sda environment variable, to allow the user to keep
# sda as the name of the disk.
#
# To avoid spinning up sleeping disks, you need the hdparm command in your PATH
