Munin consists of the main programs, and a node. The node runs on each of
the machines you want to collect data from. The main programs does the
collecting, draws the graphs, and creates the HTML pages.

To install the main programs:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the user "munin"
	- make install-main

	- create a cron-entry to run "munin-cron" as the user "munin"
	  every 5 minutes.  You might find cron files for your system
	  under the build/dists subdirectory, or perhaps in the
          build/resources directory.

	- if you want to use the dynamic graphs: Configure the cgi
	  directory, you will find a apache config example in
	  build/resources.  NOTE: Dynamic graphs are not exactly
          perfect. Se also http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/CgiHowto

To install the documentation:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- make install-doc install-man

To install a node:

	- edit Makefile.config
	- create the group "munin"
	- make install-node install-node-plugins
	- decide which plugins to use (quick auto-plug-and-play
          solution: "munin-node-configure --shell | sh")
	- start the node agent. You probably want an init-script for
          this and you might find a good one under build/dists

Notes about node plugins
------------------------

"make install-node-plugins" installs the plugins in LIBDIR (defined in
Makefile.config). Put the ones you want to use (or better yet, create
softlinks) in CONFDIR/plugins/ . An easy way to do this, is the
program "munin-node-configure", using the parameter "--shell". It will
then suggest commands to do this.

Some of the plugins require some configuration to get running.  Some
example configuration files (plugins.conf) is found under the
build/dists directory.

Many OSes and releases thereof have different ways of gathering data.
A lot of OSes still have none.  If you create plugins for an OS/system
which is not already in the package, please send us a copy of them, so
we can add them for others to use.  We'd also be happy if you sent us
any new plugins on systems already in the package.
