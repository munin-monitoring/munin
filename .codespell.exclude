It turns out that multigraph plugins are written to generate graphs for all network devices or all disk devices on a system. There is a definitive need to provide filtering (include) features, such as device name patterns for disk devices or media types for network boxes so that only e.g. ethernet and ppp devices are included in the graphs, and not the loopback and serial devices (unless the serial device is actually interesting since it's really a long haul WAN line). Or, on the other hand a exclude feature to drop specifically uninteresting things.
