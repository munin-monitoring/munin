  * Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Add a patch for munin-cron to work around a bug in munin-graph:
    munin-graph in 2.1.x is slightly broken and expects either no cli parameter
    at all or a specific string which graph to render. Upstream is aware of
    this problem. For now we fix this here, see trac#1418 for the real fix.
  * Import changes from the debian branch to debian-experimental.
  * Add configuration for apache 2.4. Some configuration parameters changed so
    a new configuration is needed. (Closes: #722654)

  * Include the changes from 2.0.6-2 as actually uploaded to sid - and not as
    proposed in #694790.
  * For 2.0.9-2 this effectively means stop using quilt (all patches have been
    removed anyway, see 2.0.6-2 changelog) and a different (=the actual)
    debian/changelog entry for 2.0.6-2. So this upload is basically a no-op.

    - debian/munin.postinst: create symlink for new installs and also for
      upgrades from versions where it was still removed (up to 1.4.6-3) but
      not re-created (from 1.4.6-1 onwards). Thanks to Gregor Herrman for the
      patch and intrigeri for reviewing. (Closes: #677943)
  * munin-doc: Break and replace munin-common << 2. (Closes: #694355)

    on purge. The plugin-state is outdated after a few minutes anyway.
    (Closes: #687715)
  * apt_all plugin: the apt_all plugin has its state updated in cron. There
    the ENV var MUNIN_PLUGSTATE doesn't exist, so we need to set a default.
    (Closes: #687495). This has been in included in 2.0.7 as d53b34d.
  * munin-async.init: Run munin-async after munin-node has been started.

    Michael Renner for the testing and the patch!
  * Patch node/munin-node.conf.in to allow incoming IPv6 from localhost,
    mostly to document that IPv6 addresses are allowed as well. Thanks to
    Daniel Black. (Closes: #676798) This is upstream commit 7501128 which was
    included in 2.0.9.

    cherry-pick c112139 from 2.0.9. (Closes: #675377)
  * HTMLConfig.pm: cherry-pick 789c59e from 2.0.7 to avoid (using the default
    configuration) /var/log/munin/munin-html.log being flooded with 106 lines
    of noisy warnings (out of 112 lines in total) every 5min. (Closes: #689291)
  * selinux_avcstat plugin: Do not use the "read without variable" bashism,
    thanks to intrigeri for the patch. (Closes: #690711)
    This fix has been included upstream as 099cc00f.
  * http_loadtime plugin: fix stderr redirection (which broke the plugin
    completely) (Closes: #691448) - This is upstream commit 9a1cbce from
    2.0.8.
  * Keep using "dh $@" (=without anything) and not change to "dh --with quilt"
    (so #691327 is still open in sid and wheezy.).
  * Drop 101-suppress-occasional-unknown-states-to-avoid-alerts.patch as it
    is included since 1.4.4.
  * Drop 100-DejaVu-Fonts-Path.patch since it only affects a codepath used
    with rrdtool 1.2.
  * Drop 237-hddtemp_smartctl-sata-detect.patch and cherry-pick the identical
    commit 29e4ca9 from 2.0.7 instead: this was the bugfix for #497400,
    included in both lenny and squeeze releases (so it fixes a regression, and
    so today introducing #497400 would be an important bug.)
  * Remove quilt from build-depends. We are not using it and have not been
    using it since March 2012 / 2.0~rc2-1.

munin (2.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release 2.0.6, switching back to cron graphing (as it better
    for small setups) and besides that only containing bugfixes, but many of
    them. See the upstream ChangeLog for the full list.
    - munin-node: more secure state file handling, introducing a new plugin
      state directory root, owned by uid 0. Then each plugin runs in its own
      UID plugin state directory, owned by the said UID. (Closes: #684075),
      (Closes: #679897), closes CVE-2012-3512.
      So all properly written plugins will use
      /var/lib/munin-node/plugin-state/$uid/$some_file now - please report
      plugins that are still using /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/ - as those
      might pose a security risk!
    - munin-cgi-graph: ignore @ARGV to fix CVE-2012-3513 (Closes: #684076),
      thanks to Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>
    - munin-cron: call munin-graph with --cron argument (Closes: #685343)
    - Master/Node.pm: fix _node_read_fast() to accept all valid returns
      (Closes: #686089) and _do_connect() to not use an uninitialized
      variable. (Closes: #686090)
    - munin-async: make spoolread less restrictive about (valid) plugin names
      (Closes: #686093)
  * Update Location and Scriptalias in shipped apache.conf to fix a regression
    introduced in fixing #682869.
  * munin-node.postinst: don't create /var/lib/munin/plugin-state anymore as
    munin-node now uses /var/lib/munin-nodes/plugin-state and subdirs and
    handles creation by itself.
  * debian/rules: workaround bug in upstream Makefile targets to move
    /var/lib/async from munin-node package to munin-async.
  * debian/control:
    - make munin-async depend on munin-node for now.
    - update Vcs: headers to point to an uptodate repository.
  * Remove build/resources/apache-cgi.conf from munin.docs as it's outdated.
  * update munin.NEWS to reflect that everybody using cgi graphing needs to
    update the configuration files and that cron graphing is the default
    again. (cgi graphing was the default from pre-2.0 until 2.0.5)

        (Closes: #668667)
      - validate url characters (Closes: #668666)

munin (2.0~rc5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * New upstream release candidate, quoting the upstream Changelog:
     - Adding the current action to the command line. Useful for debugging.
     - Adding a new URL param full_size_mode to enable predictable IMG sizes
     - Enable sparklines with the url param "only_graph"
     - Start RRD just before first update. To avoid a very costly 1st update.
     - Emit the hosts in a sorted order, instead of somewhat random.
     - Do not emit png list if file handle is not defined. (Closes: #666759)
     - Add old option of --force-root, but with a new name. more explicit
       (Closes:  #601371)
     - We do not generate the png list when using cgi html.
     - Remove warning when asking "list" w/o a hostname (LP: #907952)
     - Many bug fixes (trac: Closes #967, #1210) (Closes: #583189, #568511,
       Closes: #475078)
  * Create /var/log/munin in /etc/init.d/munin-node (Closes: #626570)
  * Cleanup the dpkg-statoverrides mess, by removing all existing
    statoverrides in munin's and munin-nodes' postinst and just running chown and
    chmod on those files and directories. Also remove statoverride handling
    from postrm scripts. (Closes: #666907)
    As far as I understand, the usage of dpkg-statoverride was plainly wrong
    for all these years. If I'm wrong here, I'd be glad to be corrected.

munin (2.0~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is not yet munin 2.0, but almost! Install at your own risk and have
    fun! Also, please give feedback to munin-users@lists.sourceforge.net or
    if you prefer IRC, go to #munin on OFTC.
  * Quoting from /usr/share/doc/munin/Announce-2.0:
    * Introducing Munin 2.0! The most important features:
    * Even better scalability through:
      - Large performance improvements on almost all munin's components:
      - Full CGI integration.  It is for graphing as  well for html, if needed.
        It is also completely compatible with FastCGI, that only compiles once
        per run.
      - Binary state data files.  This has enabled a really fast startup and
        storing of state files. Quite useful in munin limits that does need to
        access to the rrd files.
      - Complete integration with rrdcached.  Starting with RRD 1.4, there is
        an update daemon. It enables batched updates, and therefore reduce the
        IO down. Even with 1000+ files to update every 5 min.
      - Spoolfetch uses _node_read_fast() now : 3MiB is now read in 2 s instead
        of 7 min.
    * Complete IPv6 integration: (Closes: #592214, Closes: #558800, Closes:
      #567551)
      - The master only require a new perl module (IO::Socket::INET6)
      - The node needs a IPv6-patched Net::Server
    * Native SSH transport - No need to have a hairy setup anymore.
    * Graph Zooming: The UI is still raw, but right to the point.
    * New look on HTML pages, new graph colours with better contrast
    * IRC ( #munin @ OFTC ) has become a real support channel, mostly aimed at
      trunk.
    * Full details in http://munin-monitoring.org/browser/tags/2.0-rc2/ChangeLog
      or in /usr/share/doc/munin/changelog.gz on this system. (Closes: #610528,
      Closes: #644960, Closes: #576009, Closes: #474193, #660224, #609900,
      Closes: #582786, #591455)
    * This release has been prepared through six uploads to experimental and
      several users running it on their installations.

  [ Steve Schnepp ]
  * Maintained a branch since munin 1.5 all the way up to 1.999 to prepare
    munin 2.0 packages for Debian.
  * Using a 1.999.SVN naming scheme to enable rpm package building using alien
    - munin-graph is no more, only CGI is left.
  * Added support for async polling in munin-master, add new package
    munin-async.
  * Enable vectorized multiple-time updates. Speeds updates up when using
    async polling. An 1s polling rate is now possible w/o much overhead, since
    munin-update only runs every 5 min.
    - ability to keep more data (for zooming resolution mainly)
    - ability to run (some) plugins more and/or less often than every
      5 minutes
    - support of async polling, so munin-update can run less often than
      the usual 5 min. Useful if you have too much nodes and it takes
      more than 5 min to gather all the data.
    - Closes: #464880
  * Add new binary package: munin-plugins, containing the plugins previously
    included in the munin-node package. This enables us to:
    - have alternate munin-node packages in future.
    - be able to build a make-dh-perl like package building system
      for 3rd party plugins.
  * Move POD files to package munin-doc.
    - fixed duplicates (Closes: #661265)
  * Move Munin::Plugins and plugins.sh into munin-common to be able to
    install munin-plugins-extra without munin-plugins-core.
  * debian/control changes:
    - munin-async isn't recommended anymore as it will needlessly launch a
      daemon since its usage isn't automatic yet.
    - munin-async does actually depends on munin-common.
    - A more recent version of munin-common is always ok, as it is compatible.
      It enables decoupling munin, munin-node & munin-plugin-* versions.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Merge changes from 1.4.4-1 until 1.4.7-1 into this branch and merge
    debian/changelog in preparation for uploading to experimental.
  * Move packaging to
    svn://munin.projects.linpro.no/munin/branches/debian/wheezy
  * Include large parts of upstreams Announce-2.0 in debian/changelog.
  * Update to munin 2.0beta6, which has a rewrite of the timeout handling
    code. The default node timeout is now 1 min. Also various bugfixes were
    made.
  * Update maintainer address to packaging@munin-monitoring.org.
  * chmod 755 debian/ostype_helper in debian/rules. (Closes: #651449)
    Thanks Christoph Biedl.
  * Improve description of munin.init.
  * debian/control:
    - Rename munin-plugins to munin-plugins-core and make it
      provide/break/replace munin-plugins (<<1.999.4548-3~).
    - munin-java-plugins and munin-common should neither suggest munin nor
      munin-node.
    - rename munin-java-plugins to munin-plugins-java and make it replace and
      break munin-java-plugins (<<1.999.4548-3~).
    - Vcs-svn: provide path to Debian branch to avoid checking out the whole
      repo when using debcheckout.
    - Add quilt to build-depends.
  * debian/rules: support changes in debian/control.
  * munin.postrm: remove /var/log/munin/munin-cgi-html.log* on purge.
  * Add munin-async.postrm to delete the munin-async user on purge.
  * munin-async.postinst: set homedirectory to /var/lib/munin-async.
  * Move munin-doc to section doc.
  * Drop debian/patches/101-dash-bash-fw_conntrack.patch as this was fixed
    upstream properly to also fix network lag problems on big firewalls with
    the plugins fw_conntrack and fw_forwarded_local. (Closes: #565565)
  * Provide lintian-overrides for munin and munin-doc as the manpages for
    their binaries have been moved to the munin-doc package.

  [ Marc Haber ]
  * Clean up build leftovers in debian/rules clean clean to allow
    building twice in a row.

  [ Kenyon Ralph ]
  * Drop df_gnu patch which was integrated into the upstream plugin.

  [ Stig Sandbeck Mathisen ]
  * Convert debian/rules to modern debhelper version (compat level 9)
  * Suggest ruby for plugins in that language
  * Bump standards version (no changes)

  * Included plugin 'openvpn'. Closes: #354447
  * Build the binary package 'munin-plugins-extra' with user contributed
    plugins (again) by default. Though previously this package was called
    'munin-plugins-contrib'. It was renamed to avoid confusion about the term
    'contrib' which is used in Debian with a different meaning.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0, add Homepage and Vcs-* pseudo-headers.
  * Add README.source and convert it to svn-buildpackage. Thanks to Patrick
    Winnertz for help on this and writing the pbuilder part of README.source.
  * Add error checking to postinst, so the postinst (and with it dpkg) doesn't
    fail if munin-node-configure fails, for example if /proc is not mounted.
  * Provide entry about the munin-plugins-extra package in NEWS file.
  * Add suggests to logtail for munin-plugins-extra, as some of those plugins
    need it.
  * Remove the buggy and unneeded logtail version detection code in the
    amavis and courier plugins as described in #298895 and #297628. (The bugs
    were closed in the BTS when the now called 'munin-plugins-extra' package
    wasn't build on default anymore.)
  * Adjust the default path for the mail logfile as suggested in #296533.
    (Same here, bug was closed in the BTS when this binary package wasn't
    build on default anymore.)

  * New upstream release.
      - Replace calls to net_write() with print(), closes: #388789.
      - Replace calls to Net::Domain::hostfqdn() with a combination of
        Sys::Hostname::hostname() and gethostbyname(), closes: #307462,
        closes: #390815.
      - Handle errors opening the stats file in munin-update, closes: #329204.
      - Improves the default fonts in RRDtool 1.2, which caused some labels to
        line-wrap, reducing readability.  Closes: #361585.
      - munin-node-configure-snmp now handles errors better, closes: #320455.
      - Plugin generic/multips is now sorted under Processes, closes: #312521.
      - Plugin linux/apt_all now correctly counts held packages, and also
        considers the distribution "stable", closes: #314610.

  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/NEWS:
      - Add support for building a package containing the contrib plugins,
        closes: #306861.  Patch from Marc Haber, thanks!

  * debian/munin-node.init, debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Recreate /var/run/munin on boot if it is absent.  This is a work-around
        for brain-damage in Ubuntu, where this directory goes AWOL every time
        the machine is booted.  Closes: #380434.

  * debian/control:
      - The link to the example installation was broken, instead point to the
        home page where there'll always be a link to a live one.

  * debian/munin-node.init:
      - Handle pidofproc() supplying the correct return code in the situation
        where the daemon is dead while the pid file exists.  This was a bug
        in lsb-base (#381684) up to and including version 3.1-10.
      - Add LSB run-time dependency information.

  * debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Change the time of the daily forced munin-limits run so it doesn't
        start at the same time as the munin-cron process, which appeared to
        cause a race condition that made munin-limits report all values as 0.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Run the ip_ plugin as the root user, closes: #373768.

  * debian/copyright:
      - The new upstream release bundles Bitstream Vera Mono, include its

  * debian/munin-node.init, debian/control:
      - Fix killproc() call, whose interface changed in lsb-base 3.0-10.
        Version the dependency accordingly.  Closes: #339952.

  * server/munin-cron.in, server/munin-graph.in, server/munin-limits.in:

    debian/munin-node.preinst (removed), debian/munin-node.postinst:
      - Remove all code that handled upgrades from versions earlier than
        1.2.3-1.  In a way this closes: #308008.

  * debian/munin.postrm, debian/munin-node.postrm:
      - Replace "test -o" bashism with "||".

  * debian/munin-node.cron.d:
      - Update APT's package index files periodically if the apt_all plugin
        enabled, too.  Patch by Tommi Virtanen, thanks!  Closes: #317278.

  * debian/control:
      - Remove conflict declarations on the old LRRD packages.
      - Make munin-node suggest ethtool, closes: #311603.
      - Make Munin depend on rrdtool instead of merely suggesting it.  This is
        a workaround for bug #323975 and its duplicates.
      - Add a dependency on adduser for both packages.
      - Increment standards-version to 3.6.2.1, no changes required.

  * debian/munin-node.init, debian/control:
      - Reimplemented Munin-Node's init script using LSB functions.
        Closes: #326912, #326913.
      - Add a dependency on lsb-base for Munin-Node.

  * server/munin-graph.in, debian/control:
      - Replaced the patch from 1.2.3-2 with the upstream one from SVN revision
        954.  This re-enables support for RRDtool 1.0, so the versioned
        dependency on librrds-perl is dropped.

  * server/munin-cron.in:
      - Swallow bogus output from RRDtool, closes: #326061.  This is a
        (hopefully temporary) workaround for bug #325353.

        Loomans' patch to make Munin support RRDtool 1.2, closes: #324605,
        closes: #325280.  Thanks, Robert!  Note that this breaks compatibility
        with RRDtool 1.0.  Sarge users should wait for the new upstream release
        which will support both RRDtool 1.0 and 1.2.

  * debian/control:
      - Made the munin package depend on librrds-perl in versions 1.2 or above.

        program being run to the log, closes: #301196.  The references to this
        functionality has been corrected in the NEWS file, and also in the
        example config file.

      - Plugins generic/apache_* could in some cases cause spurious spikes,
        this has now been fixed.  Closes: #296454, #296645.
      - Plugin linux/df_inode now handles devices with hyphens in their names
        correctly, closes: #298442.
      - Plugin generic/exim_mailstats now graphs rejects, closes: #295799.
      - Earlier versions of munin-update could in some cases complain about
        "nested quantifiers in regex", now fixed.  Closes: #296575.
      - Fixes some broken HTML in the templates, closes: #296676.
      - Updates over very slow connections are now handled more gracefully,
        closes: #298108.

  * debian/rules, debian/plugins.conf, debian/NEWS:
      - Do not include contrib plugins in the munin-node package anymore.
        Sort-of closes: #296533, #297451, #297628, #297904, #298895.

  * debian/rules, debian/munin-node.postinst:
      - Delay startup of the node significantly, as it may require other
        monitored services (e.g. ntpd) to be already running.  Also change the
        startup time if the package is being upgraded, if the current init
        configuration is the old package's defaults.  Closes: #298793, thanks
        to Stephen Gran for noticing.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Run the Courier-MTA and Postfix plugins with necessary additional
        privileges so they work out of the box, closes: #297654, #296985.
        Thanks to Charles Fry and Juraj Bednar for pointing this out.
      - The smart_ plugin is now run as root (which is necessary).

  * debian/control:
      - Suggest acpi over lm-sensors, and not the other way around as it was
        earlier.  Both the acpi and sensors_ plugins achieve the same thing,
        but the former is auto while the latter is manual.
      - Remove the hddtemp suggestion and replace it with smartmontools,
        closes: #296361. The hddtemp* plugins was replaced with
        hddtemp_smartctl in 1.2.0.
      - Suggest python (>= 2.2), used by the smart_ plugin.
      - A few minor rewrites in the descriptions.

  * debian/munin-node.manpages:
      - Include munin-node-configure-snmp(8).

  * server/munin-limits.in:

        spurious spikes when the counters are mistakenly assumed to have
        wrapped.  This change may cause empty graphs to occur, take care to
        read NEWS.Debian before upgrading the "munin-node" package!
        Closes: #225623, #233762.
      - Munin-update no longer truncates long field names, closes: #256370.
        This may in some cases cause empty graphs, please read NEWS.Debian for
        more information before upgrading the "munin" package.
      - Replaces the old Nagios-specific integration with a much more generic
        framework for sending alerts to wherever you want.  As a side effect,
        this closes: #291168.
      - Corrects an erroneous commented example in munin.conf, closes: #294060.
      - The munin-node.conf setting default_plugin_user now actually works as
        advertised, closes: #295366, #295367.
      - Plugin generic/bind9 now source its configuration from %ENV,
        closes: #268142, #272049.
      - Plugin generic/amavis now autodetects how to correctly invoke logtail,
        closes: #284638, #288395.
      - Plugin generic/squid_cache now correctly calculates cache size when
        using multiple cache directories, closes: #288579.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now defaults to reading from a more
        correct log file, closes: #291720.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now correctly identifies the reject
        code as newer Postfix versions logs them, closes: #292110.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailvolume now has a improved graph_title (that
        is not the same as the title of generic/postfix_mailstats).
        Closes: #292083.
      - Plugin generic/named now defaults to reading from a more correct log
        file, closes: #291849.
      - Plugin linux/fw_forwarded_local now correctly reports 0 instead of
        NaN in some situations, closes: #284673.
      - Plugin linux/iostat now ignores devices that have had no I/O operations
        whatsoever and thus are assumed to be unused, closes: #267195.
      - New plugin: linux/forks. Closes: #225638.
      - New plugin: linux/uptime. Closes: #283622.
      - New plugin: linux/irqstats. Closes: #224990.

      - New plugin: generic/perdition. Closes: #291855.

  * debian/NEWS:
      - Document the changes that may lead to data loss when upgrading from
        Munin 1.0.x, and also write a bit about the new munin-limits framework.

  * debian/control:
      - Add dependency on perl-modules (>= 5.8.0) | libparse-recdescent-perl
        for the main munin package, as munin-limits requires Text::Balanced.
      - Add libdate-manip-perl as a recommended package for the munin package,
        as the new CGI functionality depends on it.
      - Change libnet-snmp-perl to be a recommended package for munin-node
        instead of only suggested, as the new munin-node-configure-snmp
        requires it.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Install the new CGI in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, as mandated by the Debian
        Policy Manual.

      - Plugin linux/fw_conntrack is now run as root as this file recently has
        changed to not be world readable, closes: #291226.
      - Plugin linux/if_ is now run as root in order to probe the speed of the
        network interface.

  * debian/munin.postinst, debian/munin-node.postinst, debian/munin.postrm,
    debian/munin-node.postrm:
      - Use dpkg-statoverride to handle the permissions on the data and log
        directories.

  * server/munin-limits.in:
      - Change lock file directory to match that of munin-update, munin-graph,
        and munin-html (grabbed from upstream CVS).
      - Fix a string comparison where the "==" operator was used instead of
        "eq" (grabbed from upstream CVS).

  * debian/munin.postinst:
      - Only change user and group ownership on the data files from "lrrd" to
        "munin" when the package is first installed, not on every upgrade.

      - Adds new plugin for NFS statistics, closes: #223775.

  * debian/rules:

        munin-node package, closes: #236939, #236972, #245104.

  * Makefile:
      - Ignore the return value of htmldoc, as it's begun returning non-zero
        if it encountered a non-fatal error in the document.

munin (0+1.0.0pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #231049:
      - Project renamed from "LRRD" to "Munin".  Almost every file in the
        debian directory has changed both name and content due to this, and
        the changes related to this are far too numerous to detail here.
      - iostat plugin now works on Linux 2.6, closes: #224113.
      - mysql_queries now appends ".value" to the fields, closes: #224118.
      - Munin-node now ignores config files names suggesting they're backup
        files of some sort (such as "foo.dpkg-old"), closes: #224265.
      - Munin-node now doesn't attempt to drop privileges using setuid() and
        setgid() if it's not running as root to begin with, closes: #224300.
      - Untaint %ENV unconditionally;  let the admin shoot himself in the foot
        if he wants to, closes: #224838, #224878.
      - Munin-update now allows any character in service names (although it
        translates exotic ones to "_"), closes: #224859.
      - Munin-graph now handles bogus input from plugins more gracefully,
        closes: #224942.
      - Munin-update doesn't any longer complain on stderr if a node times out
        in mid-transfer, closes: #227650.
      - Incorporates Mike Fedyk's many improvements to the memory plugin,
        closes: #223346.
      - The iostat graph is now mirrored over the X axis, making it much
        easier to read, closes: #223373.
      - Fix buggy HTML in the service view, closes: #230322.
      - Limit the maximum values from the vmstat plugin to 500000, to avoid
        spurious peaks to sneak in, closes: #225489, #225626.
      - Further improvements to related to timeout handling, closes: #224480.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Run the Exim mailstats plugin in the groups "mail" and "adm", to
        ensure we can read the log files we need, closes: #225988.
      - Run the Exim mailqueue plugin with "Debian-exim" as a supplementary
        group if it exists, closes: #229860.

  * debian/munin-node.init:
      - Use a full string match instead of a substring match when looking
        in the process table for running Munin-node processes, closes: #224486.
      - Remove $(<file) bashism, closes: #230116.

  * debian/munin.preinst (new), debian/munin-node.preinst (new):
      - If we're doing an initial install of either of the Munin packages
        on a system with LRRD configuration files and data lying around,
        create the initial Munin configuration and data set based on the
        old files from LRRD.

lrrd (0.9.9r5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
      - Allows for customizing which port to connect to when the server is
        talking to its clients, closes: #214114.
      - Makes it possible to change the plugins' environment arbitrarily,
        sort-of closes: #214277.
      - Relaxes the paranoia regarding the plugins' ownership and permission
        modes somewhat, closes: #214186, #216401.
      - Further improvements to the error-handling logic in lrrd-server, which
        hopefully closes: #215739, #222674, #222821.
      - Removed the spurious use of Config::General in lrrd-client,
        closes: #216176.
      - Includes Andras Korn's psu_ wildcard plugin, which counts the number
        of processes owned by specific users, closes: #214210.  Thanks, Andras!
      - The number of context switches per second is now graphed by the
        interrupts plugin, closes: #222838.  Thanks, Mike Fedyk!
      - Corrected field names in the vmstat plugin, closes: #222841.  Thanks
        again, Mike Fedyk!

  * debian/control:
      - Drop dependency on libconfig-general-perl for lrrd-server, as this
        configuration file format is now deprecated.
      - Change priority to extra, due to the dependency on librrds-perl.

  * debian/rules:
      - Polished slightly.

  * debian/lrrd-client.dirs:
      - Removed unnecessary entry /var/run/lrrd, which is installed from the
        Makefile.

  * debian/lrrd-client.init:
      - Rewritten, now sports improved error handling and intrinsic distrust of
        start-stop-daemon's return values, closes: #202190.

  * debian/lrrd-server.cron.d:
      - Check if the binaries we're about to run exist and are executable
        before running them, closes: #221691.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - If we're updating from the packages which didn't create the lrrd system
        group, try to make the GID the same as the already existing lrrd users'
        UID, if it's available.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
      - Rewritten as a shell script.
      - Initial plugin setup now relies on lrrd-client-configure instead of an
        internal function to to initialize plugins.  This also ensures that
        automatic plugins later added to the package will be enabled on
        upgrades.
      - The plugins' state files was inappropriately placed in /var/run, move
        them to /var/lib if any exist in the former location.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - Actually check how we're called, don't blindly assume we're
        configuring.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm, debian/lrrd-client.postrm:
      - Better handling of empty dirs after purge.  (This is workaround for
        dpkg bug #198522).

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm:
      - Remove some ucf stuff I had forgotten about.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Updated to the new syntax for passing options to the plugins.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Now only contains overrides to the upstream defaults, instead of being
        a full replacement for upstream's Makefile.config.
      - PLUGSTATE changed from /var/run/lrrd to /var/lib/lrrd/plugin-state, as
        these files should persist after reboots.

      autoconf values are correct.

      dpkg conffile.  This is made possible by using the new configuration
      setting 'use_default_name'.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Add the system group lrrd as well as a system user, and ensure that all
      data directories are owned and writeble by these.

lrrd (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct path to lrrd-nagios in /etc/cron.d/lrrd-server, closes: #202803.
  * Use Net::Domain instead of /bin/hostname when generating server.conf,
    to ensure the hostname matches the client's, closes: #203960.
  * Do not determine the hostname and domain during build.

lrrd (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Massive changes in build system, update debian/rules accordingly.
    - The server will now ignore unreachable nodes, and should thus not
      send root arcane error messages anymore, closes: #200487.
  * After reading through the texmf.cnf thread on debian-devel, I realize
    I've forgotten the simplizity and no-nonsense qulities about Debian
    that attracted me in the first place, and that I've fallen for the
    temptation of making the configuration scripts too pretentious and
    loquacious. Therefore, I've killed all of the Debconf questions, and
    instead enable a default set of plugins based on the autoconf and
    suggests routines, closes: #197413.
  * /etc/lrrd/client.conf is now a conffile handled by dpkg.
  * Rewrote lrrd-client's postinst in Perl.
  * Include the APT plugin in the lrrd-client package.  Hence, the
    lrrd-client package now Conflicts and Replaces lrrd-plugin-apt.
    Thanks to James Troup for the suggestion.
  * Declare the debhelper compat level in debian/compat instead of in
    debian/rules.
  * Standards-Version 3.6.0, no changes required.
