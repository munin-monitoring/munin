munin (1.4.5-3+deb6u1) squeeze-lts; urgency=low

  [ Christoph Biedl ]
  * munin-node: more secure state file handling, introducing a new plugin
    state directory root, owned by uid 0. Then each plugin runs in its own
    UID plugin state directory, owned by that UID. (Closes: #684075),
    (Closes: #679897), closes CVE-2012-3512.
  * plugins: use runtime $ENV{MUNIN_PLUGSTATE}. So all properly written
    plugins will use /var/lib/munin-node/plugin-state/$uid/$some_file now -
    please report plugins that are still using /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/ -
    as those  might pose a security risk!
  * Validate multigraph plugin name, CVE-2013-6048.
  * Don't abort data collection for a node due to malicious node, fixing
    munin#1397, CVE-2013-6359.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Convert Christophs git commits into debian/patches, make his changelog

  * Fix the exim detection in exim_mailqueue with the patch from Damyan
    Ivanov, thanks! Closes: #486865
  * Replace the wrong filehandle close in exim_mailstats through tail_close().
    Closes: #486868
  * Remove the "-w" from the hash bang line of ntp_offset since nether dash
    nor bash (or ksh) knows this parameter. Closes: #486887
  * Change maintainer mail back to munin-deb-maint@linpro.no
  * To become compatible with Nagios substitute "%" by "percent" in graph
    title of plugins df and df_inode. Thanks Andreas Beckmann, Closes: #472239
  * The plugin smart_ will not longer spin up disks in standby mode. Added "-n
    standby" to the smartctl call. In plugin hddtemp_smartctl this issue was
    already fixed upstream. Closes: #409462
  * Included plugin 'ups_'. Thanks Andras Korn! Closes: #305917
  * Set default logfile to mail.conf for postfix_mailvolume in plugins.conf
    since Debian's postfix logs there. In the plugin postfix_mailstats this
    issue was already fixed upstream. Closes: #461302
  * Added detection of slashes in plugin ip_'s suggest mode. 
    Closes: #464881, #411643, #402881
  * Included plugin 'openvpn'. Closes: #354447
  * Build the binary package 'munin-plugins-extra' with user contributed 
    plugins (again) by default. Though previously this package was called
    'munin-plugins-contrib'. It was renamed to avoid confusion about the term 
    'contrib' which is used in Debian with a different meaning.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0, add Homepage and Vcs-* pseudo-headers.
  * Add README.source and convert it to svn-buildpackage. Thanks to Patrick
    Winnertz for help on this and writing the pbuilder part of README.source.   
  * Add error checking to postinst, so the postinst (and with it dpkg) doesn't
    fail if munin-node-configure fails, for example if /proc is not mounted.
  * Provide entry about the munin-plugins-extra package in NEWS file.
  * Add suggests to logtail for munin-plugins-extra, as some of those plugins
    need it.
  * Remove the buggy and unneeded logtail version detection code in the
    amavis and courier plugins as described in #298895 and #297628. (The bugs
    were closed in the BTS when the now called 'munin-plugins-extra' package
    wasn't build on default anymore.)
  * Adjust the default path for the mail logfile as suggested in #296533.

      - Handle errors opening the stats file in munin-update, closes: #329204.

      - Plugin generic/multips is now sorted under Processes, closes: #312521.

        closes: #306861.  Patch from Marc Haber, thanks!

  * debian/munin-node.init, debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Recreate /var/run/munin on boot if it is absent.  This is a work-around
        for brain-damage in Ubuntu, where this directory goes AWOL every time
        the machine is booted.  Closes: #380434.

  * debian/control:
      - The link to the example installation was broken, instead point to the
        home page where there'll always be a link to a live one.

  * debian/munin-node.init:
      - Handle pidofproc() supplying the correct return code in the situation
        where the daemon is dead while the pid file exists.  This was a bug
        in lsb-base (#381684) up to and including version 3.1-10.
      - Add LSB run-time dependency information.

  * debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Change the time of the daily forced munin-limits run so it doesn't
        start at the same time as the munin-cron process, which appeared to
        cause a race condition that made munin-limits report all values as 0.

        startup time if the package is being upgraded, if the current init
        configuration is the old package's defaults.  Closes: #298793, thanks

munin (0+1.0.0pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #231049:
      - Project renamed from "LRRD" to "Munin".  Almost every file in the

        setgid() if it's not running as root to begin with, closes: #224300.

        if he wants to, closes: #224838, #224878.
      - Munin-update now allows any character in service names (although it
        translates exotic ones to "_"), closes: #224859.
      - Munin-graph now handles bogus input from plugins more gracefully,
        closes: #224942.
      - Munin-update doesn't any longer complain on stderr if a node times out

      - Incorporates Mike Fedyk's many improvements to the memory plugin,
        closes: #223346.

      - Fix buggy HTML in the service view, closes: #230322.
      - Limit the maximum values from the vmstat plugin to 500000, to avoid

        in the process table for running Munin-node processes, closes: #224486.
      - Remove $(<file) bashism, closes: #230116.

  * debian/munin.preinst (new), debian/munin-node.preinst (new):
      - If we're doing an initial install of either of the Munin packages
        on a system with LRRD configuration files and data lying around,
        create the initial Munin configuration and data set based on the
        old files from LRRD.

lrrd (0.9.9r5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
      - Allows for customizing which port to connect to when the server is
        talking to its clients, closes: #214114.
      - Makes it possible to change the plugins' environment arbitrarily,
        sort-of closes: #214277.
      - Relaxes the paranoia regarding the plugins' ownership and permission
        modes somewhat, closes: #214186, #216401.
      - Further impovements to the error-handling logic in lrrd-server, which
        hopefully closes: #215739, #222674, #222821.
      - Removed the spurious use of Config::General in lrrd-client,
        closes: #216176.
      - Includes Andras Korn's psu_ wildcard plugin, which counts the number
        of processes owned by specific users, closes: #214210.  Thanks, Andras!
      - The number of context switches per second is now graphed by the
        interrupts plugin, closes: #222838.  Thanks, Mike Fedyk!
      - Corrected field names in the vmstat plugin, closes: #222841.  Thanks
        again, Mike Fedyk!

  * debian/control:
      - Drop dependency on libconfig-general-perl for lrrd-server, as this
        configuration file format is now deprecated.
      - Change priority to extra, due to the dependency on librrds-perl.

  * debian/rules:
      - Polished slightly.

  * debian/lrrd-client.dirs:
      - Removed unecessary entry /var/run/lrrd, which is installed from the
        Makefile.

  * debian/lrrd-client.init:
      - Rewritten, now sports improved error handling and intrinsic distrust of
        start-stop-daemon's return values, closes: #202190.

  * debian/lrrd-server.cron.d:
      - Check if the binaries we're about to run exist and are executable
        before running them, closes: #221691.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - If we're updating from the packages which didn't create the lrrd system
        group, try to make the GID the same as the already existing lrrd users'
        UID, if it's available.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
      - Rewritten as a shell script.
      - Initial plugin setup now relies on lrrd-client-configure instead of an
        internal function to to initialize plugins.  This also ensures that
        automatic plugins later added to the package will be enabled on
        upgrades.
      - The plugins' state files was inappropriately placed in /var/run, move
        them to /var/lib if any exist in the former location.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - Actually check how we're called, don't blindly assume we're
        configuring.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm, debian/lrrd-client.postrm:
      - Better handling of empty dirs after purge.  (This is workaround for
        dpkg bug #198522).

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm:
      - Remove some ucf stuff I had forgotten about.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Updated to the new syntax for passing options to the plugins.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Now only contains overrides to the upstream defaults, instead of being
        a full replacement for upstream's Makefile.config.
      - PLUGSTATE changed from /var/run/lrrd to /var/lib/lrrd/plugin-state, as
        these files should persist after reboots.

      autoconf values are correct.
  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:

      dpkg conffile.  This is made possible by using the new configuration
      setting 'use_default_name'.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Add the system group lrrd as well as a system user, and ensure that all
      data directories are owned and writeble by these.
  * debian/plugins.conf (new):
    - Includes configuration settings for the plugins.
  * debian/lrrd-client.docs (new), debian/lrrd-server.docs (new):

lrrd (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct path to lrrd-nagios in /etc/cron.d/lrrd-server, closes: #202803.

lrrd (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Massive changes in build system, update debian/rules accordingly.
    - The server will now ignore unreachable nodes, and should thus not
      send root arcane error messages anymore, closes: #200487.
  * After reading through the texmf.cnf thread on debian-devel, I realize
    I've forgotten the simplizity and no-nonsense qulities about Debian
    that attracted me in the first place, and that I've fallen for the
    temptation of making the configuration scripts too pretentious and
    loquacious. Therefore, I've killed all of the Debconf questions, and
    instead enable a default set of plugins based on the autoconf and
    suggests routines, closes: #197413.
  * /etc/lrrd/client.conf is now a conffile handled by dpkg.
  * Rewrote lrrd-client's postinst in Perl.
  * Include the APT plugin in the lrrd-client package.  Hence, the
    lrrd-client package now Conflicts and Replaces lrrd-plugin-apt.
    Thanks to James Troup for the suggestion.
  * Declare the debhelper compat level in debian/compat instead of in
    debian/rules.
  * Standards-Version 3.6.0, no changes required.
