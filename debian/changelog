munin (2.0.9-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/plugin.conf:
    - remove exclude example from [df*]. (Closes: #694531)
    - run sendmail_* plugins as smmta user. (Closes: #606465)
  * debian/*.postinst:
    - only (try to) create users on first install, not on every upgrade.
    - only configure apache on first install.
    - add better comments what legacy code to remove after
    squeeze-sloppy-backports.

munin (2.0.9-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Include the changes from 2.0.6-2 as actually uploaded to sid - and not as
    proposed in #694790.
  * For 2.0.9-2 this effectively means stop using quilt (all patches have
    been removed anyway, see 2.0.6-2 changelog) and a different (=the actual)
    debian/changelog entry for 2.0.6-2. So this upload is basically a no-op.
  * Which actually means that 2.0.9-2 equals 2.0.9 plus 099cc00f, which was
    added in 2.0.6-2.

munin (2.0.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release(s).
    - Drop all debian/patches/ (except 100-DejaVu-Fonts-Path.patch) as they
      were included in 2.0.7-2.0.9.
  * Remove libcgi-fast-perl from munin's depends.
  * Add libapache2-mod-fcgid to munin's suggests.
  * Support libapache2-mod-fcgid in /etc/munin/apache.conf out of the box
    (Closes: #695228), remove configuration for libapache2-mod-fastcgi as it's
    non-free. (Closes: #683112)

munin (2.0.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: set MUNIN_VERSION correctly during build. (Closes: #694527)
  * debian/munin-async.logrotate:
    - use adm group for created files.
    - use *0 as glob, not *.0 (Closes: #691758)

munin (2.0.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix "/etc/apache2/conf.d/munin removed on upgrade":
    - debian/munin.postinst: create symlink for new installs and also for
      upgrades from versions where it was still removed (up to 1.4.6-3) but
      not re-created (from 1.4.6-1 onwards). Thanks to Gregor Herrman for the
      patch and intrigeri for reviewing. (Closes: #677943)
  * munin-doc: Break and replace munin-common << 2. (Closes: #694355)
  * munin-node.postinst: delete /var/lib/munin(-node)/plugin-state recursively
    on purge. The plugin-state is outdated after a few minutes anyway.
    (Closes: #687715)
  * apt_all plugin: the apt_all plugin has its state updated in cron. There
    the ENV var MUNIN_PLUGSTATE doesn't exist, so we need to set a default.
    (Closes: #687495). This has been in included in 2.0.7 as d53b34d.
  * munin-async.init: Run munin-async after munin-node has been started.
    (Closes: #691390) - Thanks to Daniel Black for this and the next two
    fixes:
  * munin-async.postinst: fix /var/lib/munin-async ownership (once on upgrades
    from previous versions) and for new installs. (Closes: #691309)
  * munin-async.logrotate: correct location of munin-async logfiles.
    (Closes: #691758)
  * Add documentation for munin-async, thanks to Daniel Black.
    (Closes: #681803)
  * Have master support multi-homed nodes that only listen on IPv4.
    (Closes: #678662) This is upstream commit a18229c5 from 2.0.9, thanks to
    Michael Renner for the testing and the patch!
  * Patch node/munin-node.conf.in to allow incoming IPv6 from localhost,
    mostly to document that IPv6 addresses are allowed as well. Thanks to
    Daniel Black. (Closes: #676798) This is upstream commit 7501128 which was
    included in 2.0.9.
  * Common/TLS.pm: use the correct error checking functions from Net::SSLeay,
    cherry-pick c112139 from 2.0.9. (Closes: #675377)
  * HTMLConfig.pm: cherry-pick 789c59e from 2.0.7 to avoid (using the default
    configuration) /var/log/munin/munin-html.log being flooded with 106 lines
    of noisy warnings (out of 112 lines in total) every 5min. (Closes: #689291)
  * selinux_avcstat plugin: Do not use the "read without variable" bashism,
    thanks to intrigeri for the patch. (Closes: #690711)
    This fix has been included upstream as 099cc00f.
  * http_loadtime plugin: fix stderr redirection (which broke the plugin
    completely) (Closes: #691448) - This is upstream commit 9a1cbce from
    2.0.8.
  * Keep using "dh $@" (=without anything) and not change to "dh --with quilt"
    (so #691327 is still open in sid and wheezy.).
  * Drop 101-suppress-occasional-unknown-states-to-avoid-alerts.patch as it
    is included since 1.4.4.
  * Drop 100-DejaVu-Fonts-Path.patch since it only affects a codepath used
    with rrdtool 1.2.
  * Drop 237-hddtemp_smartctl-sata-detect.patch and cherry-pick the identical
    commit 29e4ca9 from 2.0.7 instead: this was the bugfix for #497400,
    included in both lenny and squeeze releases (so it fixes a regression, and
    so today introducing #497400 would be an important bug.)
  * Remove quilt from build-depends. We are not using it and have not been
    using it since March 2012 / 2.0~rc2-1.

munin (2.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release 2.0.6, switching back to cron graphing (as it better
    for small setups) and besides that only containing bugfixes, but many of
    them. See the upstream ChangeLog for the full list.
    - munin-node: more secure state file handling, introducing a new plugin
      state directory root, owned by uid 0. Then each plugin runs in its own
      UID plugin state directory, owned by the said UID. (Closes: #684075),
      (Closes: #679897), closes CVE-2012-3512.
      So all properly written plugins will use
      /var/lib/munin-node/plugin-state/$uid/$some_file now - please report
      plugins that are still using /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/ - as those
      might pose a security risk!
    - munin-cgi-graph: ignore @ARGV to fix CVE-2012-3513 (Closes: #684076),
      thanks to Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>
    - munin-cron: call munin-graph with --cron argument (Closes: #685343)
    - Master/Node.pm: fix _node_read_fast() to accept all valid returns
      (Closes: #686089) and _do_connect() to not use an uninitialized
      variable. (Closes: #686090)
    - munin-async: make spoolread less restrictive about (valid) plugin names
      (Closes: #686093)
  * Update Location and Scriptalias in shipped apache.conf to fix a regression
    introduced in fixing #682869.
  * munin-node.postinst: don't create /var/lib/munin/plugin-state anymore as
    munin-node now uses /var/lib/munin-nodes/plugin-state and subdirs and
    handles creation by itself.
  * debian/rules: workaround bug in upstream Makefile targets to move
    /var/lib/async from munin-node package to munin-async.
  * debian/control:
    - make munin-async depend on munin-node for now.
    - update Vcs: headers to point to an uptodate repository.
  * Remove build/resources/apache-cgi.conf from munin.docs as it's outdated.
  * update munin.NEWS to reflect that everybody using cgi graphing needs to
    update the configuration files and that cron graphing is the default
    again. (cgi graphing was the default from pre-2.0 until 2.0.5)

  * Remove workaround  concerning java-plugins (667493) in debian/rules
    as upstream has fixed this in e7e29c4 in 2.0.3.
  * munin-async.init:
    - run munin-async as munin-async user (Closes: #684171)
    - use stop function from munin-node.init to make it actually stop it
      (Closes: #684170). In the future we should replace both initscripts with
      saner rewrites.

      - don't cache URL with parameters anymore, and don't keep uncached URLs
        (Closes: #668667)
      - validate url characters (Closes: #668666)
      - add a max setting for cgi image size. (Closes: #670811)
    - Plugin fixes:
      - add explicit license for all plugins. (Closes: #670428)

munin (2.0~rc5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * New upstream release candidate, quoting the upstream Changelog:
     - Adding the current action to the command line. Useful for debugging.
     - Adding a new URL param full_size_mode to enable predictable IMG sizes
     - Enable sparklines with the url param "only_graph"
     - Start RRD just before first update. To avoid a very costly 1st update.
     - Emit the hosts in a sorted order, instead of somewhat random.
     - Do not emit png list if file handle is not defined. (Closes: #666759)
     - Add old option of --force-root, but with a new name. more explicit
       (Closes:  #601371)
     - We do not generate the png list when using cgi html.
     - Remove warning when asking "list" w/o a hostname (LP: #907952)
     - Many bug fixes (trac: Closes #967, #1210) (Closes: #583189, #568511,
       Closes: #475078)
  * Create /var/log/munin in /etc/init.d/munin-node (Closes: #626570)
  * Cleanup the dpkg-statoverrides mess, by removing all existing
    statoverrides in munin's and munin-nodes' postinst and just running chown and
    chmod on those files and directories. Also remove statoverride handling
    from postrm scripts. (Closes: #666907)
    As far as I understand, the usage of dpkg-statoverride was plainly wrong
    for all these years. If I'm wrong here, I'd be glad to be corrected.

munin (2.0~rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is not yet munin 2.0, but almost! Install at your own risk and have
    fun! Also, please give feedback to munin-users@lists.sourceforge.net or
    if you prefer IRC, go to #munin on OFTC.
  * Quoting from /usr/share/doc/munin/Announce-2.0:
    * Introducing Munin 2.0! The most important features:
    * Even better scalability through:
      - Large performance improvements on almost all munin's components:
      - Full CGI integration.  It is for graphing as  well for html, if needed.
        It is also completely compatible with FastCGI, that only compiles once
        per run.
      - Binary state data files.  This has enabled a really fast startup and
        storing of state files. Quite useful in munin limits that does need to
        access to the rrd files.
      - Complete integration with rrdcached.  Starting with RRD 1.4, there is
        an update daemon. It enables batched updates, and therefore reduce the
        IO down. Even with 1000+ files to update every 5 min.
      - Spoolfetch uses _node_read_fast() now : 3MiB is now read in 2 s instead
        of 7 min.
    * Complete IPv6 integration: (Closes: #592214, Closes: #558800, Closes:
      #567551)
      - The master only require a new perl module (IO::Socket::INET6)
      - The node needs a IPv6-patched Net::Server
    * Native SSH transport - No need to have a hairy setup anymore.
    * Graph Zooming: The UI is still raw, but right to the point.
    * New look on HTML pages, new graph colours with better contrast
    * IRC ( #munin @ OFTC ) has become a real support channel, mostly aimed at
      trunk.
    * Full details in http://munin-monitoring.org/browser/tags/2.0-rc2/ChangeLog
      or in /usr/share/doc/munin/changelog.gz on this system. (Closes: #610528,
      Closes: #644960, Closes: #576009, Closes: #474193, #660224, #609900,
      Closes: #582786, #591455)
    * This release has been prepared through six uploads to experimental and
      several users running it on their installations.

  [ Steve Schnepp ]
  * Maintained a branch since munin 1.5 all the way up to 1.999 to prepare
    munin 2.0 packages for Debian.
  * Using a 1.999.SVN naming scheme to enable rpm package building using alien
    - munin-graph is no more, only CGI is left.
  * Added support for async polling in munin-master, add new package
    munin-async.
  * Enable vectorized multiple-time updates. Speeds updates up when using
    async polling. An 1s polling rate is now possible w/o much overhead, since
    munin-update only runs every 5 min.
    - ability to keep more data (for zooming resolution mainly)
    - ability to run (some) plugins more and/or less often than every
      5 minutes
    - support of async polling, so munin-update can run less often than
      the usual 5 min. Useful if you have too much nodes and it takes
      more than 5 min to gather all the data.
    - Closes: #464880
  * Add new binary package: munin-plugins, containing the plugins previously
    included in the munin-node package. This enables us to:
    - have alternate munin-node packages in future.
    - be able to build a make-dh-perl like package building system
      for 3rd party plugins.
  * Move POD files to package munin-doc.
    - fixed duplicates (Closes: #661265)
  * Move Munin::Plugins and plugins.sh into munin-common to be able to
    install munin-plugins-extra without munin-plugins-core.
  * debian/control changes:
    - munin-async isn't recommended anymore as it will needlessly launch a
      daemon since its usage isn't automatic yet.
    - munin-async does actually depends on munin-common.
    - A more recent version of munin-common is always ok, as it is compatible.
      It enables decoupling munin, munin-node & munin-plugin-* versions.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Merge changes from 1.4.4-1 until 1.4.7-1 into this branch and merge
    debian/changelog in preparation for uploading to experimental.
  * Move packaging to
    svn://munin.projects.linpro.no/munin/branches/debian/wheezy
  * Include large parts of upstreams Announce-2.0 in debian/changelog.
  * Update to munin 2.0beta6, which has a rewrite of the timeout handling
    code. The default node timeout is now 1 min. Also various bugfixes were
    made.
  * Update maintainer address to packaging@munin-monitoring.org.
  * chmod 755 debian/ostype_helper in debian/rules. (Closes: #651449)
    Thanks Christoph Biedl.
  * Improve description of munin.init.
  * debian/control:
    - Rename munin-plugins to munin-plugins-core and make it
      provide/break/replace munin-plugins (<<1.999.4548-3~).
    - munin-java-plugins and munin-common should neither suggest munin nor
      munin-node.
    - rename munin-java-plugins to munin-plugins-java and make it replace and
      break munin-java-plugins (<<1.999.4548-3~).
    - Vcs-svn: provide path to Debian branch to avoid checking out the whole
      repo when using debcheckout.
    - Add quilt to build-depends.
  * debian/rules: support changes in debian/control.
  * munin.postrm: remove /var/log/munin/munin-cgi-html.log* on purge.
  * Add munin-async.postrm to delete the munin-async user on purge.
  * munin-async.postinst: set homedirectory to /var/lib/munin-async.
  * Move munin-doc to section doc.
  * Drop debian/patches/101-dash-bash-fw_conntrack.patch as this was fixed
    upstream properly to also fix network lag problems on big firewalls with
    the plugins fw_conntrack and fw_forwarded_local. (Closes: #565565)
  * Provide lintian-overrides for munin and munin-doc as the manpages for
    their binaries have been moved to the munin-doc package.

  [ Marc Haber ]
  * Clean up build leftovers in debian/rules clean clean to allow
    building twice in a row.

  [ Kenyon Ralph ]
  * Drop df_gnu patch which was integrated into the upstream plugin.

  [ Stig Sandbeck Mathisen ]
  * Convert debian/rules to modern debhelper version (compat level 9)

  [ Matthias Schmitz ]
  * Since version 1.3.x rrdtool / librrds uses libpango which needs its input
    utf8 encoded. Because all munin plugins are latin1 munin-graph now encodes
    the strings into utf8 before feeding them to librrds. (Closes: #494547)
    Also mention the need for latin-1 encoded plugins in
    munin-node.README.Debian.
  * Included postgresql plugins. (Closes: #320079) Add libdbd-pg-perl
    to munin-node suggests.
  * Make munin-node suggests of smartmontools versioned to >=5.37-6~bpo40+1
    because this version contains fixes for CCISS controllers needed by
    plugin hddtemp_smartctl, to help backporters. (Closes: #488357)

  * Replace the wrong filehandle close in exim_mailstats through tail_close().
    Closes: #486868
  * Remove the "-w" from the hash bang line of ntp_offset since nether dash
    nor bash (or ksh) knows this parameter. Closes: #486887
  * Change maintainer mail back to munin-deb-maint@linpro.no
  * To become compatible with Nagios substitute "%" by "percent" in graph
    title of plugins df and df_inode. Thanks Andreas Beckmann, Closes: #472239
  * The plugin smart_ will not longer spin up disks in standby mode. Added "-n
    standby" to the smartctl call. In plugin hddtemp_smartctl this issue was
    already fixed upstream. Closes: #409462
  * Included plugin 'ups_'. Thanks Andras Korn! Closes: #305917
  * Set default logfile to mail.conf for postfix_mailvolume in plugins.conf
    since Debian's postfix logs there. In the plugin postfix_mailstats this
    issue was already fixed upstream. Closes: #461302
  * Added detection of slashes in plugin ip_'s suggest mode.
    Closes: #464881, #411643, #402881
  * Included plugin 'openvpn'. Closes: #354447
  * Build the binary package 'munin-plugins-extra' with user contributed
    plugins (again) by default. Though previously this package was called
    'munin-plugins-contrib'. It was renamed to avoid confusion about the term
    'contrib' which is used in Debian with a different meaning.

  [ Holger Levsen ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0, add Homepage and Vcs-* pseudo-headers.
  * Add README.source and convert it to svn-buildpackage. Thanks to Patrick
    Winnertz for help on this and writing the pbuilder part of README.source.
  * Add error checking to postinst, so the postinst (and with it dpkg) doesn't
    fail if munin-node-configure fails, for example if /proc is not mounted.
  * Provide entry about the munin-plugins-extra package in NEWS file.
  * Add suggests to logtail for munin-plugins-extra, as some of those plugins
    need it.
  * Remove the buggy and unneeded logtail version detection code in the
    amavis and courier plugins as described in #298895 and #297628. (The bugs
    were closed in the BTS when the now called 'munin-plugins-extra' package
    wasn't build on default anymore.)

      - Handle errors opening the stats file in munin-update, closes: #329204.

      - Plugin generic/multips is now sorted under Processes, closes: #312521.

        closes: #306861.  Patch from Marc Haber, thanks!

  * debian/munin-node.init, debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Recreate /var/run/munin on boot if it is absent.  This is a work-around
        for brain-damage in Ubuntu, where this directory goes AWOL every time
        the machine is booted.  Closes: #380434.

  * debian/control:
      - The link to the example installation was broken, instead point to the
        home page where there'll always be a link to a live one.

  * debian/munin-node.init:
      - Handle pidofproc() supplying the correct return code in the situation
        where the daemon is dead while the pid file exists.  This was a bug
        in lsb-base (#381684) up to and including version 3.1-10.
      - Add LSB run-time dependency information.

  * debian/munin.cron.d:
      - Change the time of the daily forced munin-limits run so it doesn't
        start at the same time as the munin-cron process, which appeared to
        cause a race condition that made munin-limits report all values as 0.

      - Plugin linux/fw_conntrack is now run as root as this file recently has
        changed to not be world readable, closes: #291226.

        network interface.

  * debian/munin.postinst, debian/munin-node.postinst, debian/munin.postrm,
    debian/munin-node.postrm:
      - Use dpkg-statoverride to handle the permissions on the data and log
        directories.

  * server/munin-limits.in:
      - Change lock file directory to match that of munin-update, munin-graph,
        and munin-html (grabbed from upstream CVS).
      - Fix a string comparisons where the "==" operator was used instead of
        "eq" (grabbed from upstream CVS).

  * debian/munin.postinst:
      - Only change user and group ownership on the data files from "lrrd" to
        "munin" when the package is first installed, not on every upgrade.

munin (0+1.0.0pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #231049:
      - Project renamed from "LRRD" to "Munin".  Almost every file in the
        debian directory has changed both name and content due to this, and
        the changes related to this are far too numerous to detail here.

        setgid() if it's not running as root to begin with, closes: #224300.

        if he wants to, closes: #224838, #224878.
      - Munin-update now allows any character in service names (although it
        translates exotic ones to "_"), closes: #224859.
      - Munin-graph now handles bogus input from plugins more gracefully,
        closes: #224942.
      - Munin-update doesn't any longer complain on stderr if a node times out
        in mid-transfer, closes: #227650.
      - Incorporates Mike Fedyk's many improvements to the memory plugin,
        closes: #223346.

      - Fix buggy HTML in the service view, closes: #230322.
      - Limit the maximum values from the vmstat plugin to 500000, to avoid

  * debian/plugins.conf:

        in the process table for running Munin-node processes, closes: #224486.
      - Remove $(<file) bashism, closes: #230116.

  * debian/munin.preinst (new), debian/munin-node.preinst (new):
      - If we're doing an initial install of either of the Munin packages
        on a system with LRRD configuration files and data lying around,
        create the initial Munin configuration and data set based on the
        old files from LRRD.

lrrd (0.9.9r5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
      - Allows for customizing which port to connect to when the server is
        talking to its clients, closes: #214114.
      - Makes it possible to change the plugins' environment arbitrarily,
        sort-of closes: #214277.
      - Relaxes the paranoia regarding the plugins' ownership and permission
        modes somewhat, closes: #214186, #216401.
      - Further improvements to the error-handling logic in lrrd-server, which
        hopefully closes: #215739, #222674, #222821.
      - Removed the spurious use of Config::General in lrrd-client,
        closes: #216176.
      - Includes Andras Korn's psu_ wildcard plugin, which counts the number
        of processes owned by specific users, closes: #214210.  Thanks, Andras!
      - The number of context switches per second is now graphed by the
        interrupts plugin, closes: #222838.  Thanks, Mike Fedyk!
      - Corrected field names in the vmstat plugin, closes: #222841.  Thanks
        again, Mike Fedyk!

  * debian/control:
      - Drop dependency on libconfig-general-perl for lrrd-server, as this
        configuration file format is now deprecated.
      - Change priority to extra, due to the dependency on librrds-perl.

  * debian/rules:
      - Polished slightly.

  * debian/lrrd-client.dirs:
      - Removed unnecessary entry /var/run/lrrd, which is installed from the
        Makefile.

  * debian/lrrd-client.init:
      - Rewritten, now sports improved error handling and intrinsic distrust of
        start-stop-daemon's return values, closes: #202190.

  * debian/lrrd-server.cron.d:
      - Check if the binaries we're about to run exist and are executable
        before running them, closes: #221691.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - If we're updating from the packages which didn't create the lrrd system
        group, try to make the GID the same as the already existing lrrd users'
        UID, if it's available.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
      - Rewritten as a shell script.
      - Initial plugin setup now relies on lrrd-client-configure instead of an
        internal function to to initialize plugins.  This also ensures that
        automatic plugins later added to the package will be enabled on
        upgrades.
      - The plugins' state files was inappropriately placed in /var/run, move
        them to /var/lib if any exist in the former location.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - Actually check how we're called, don't blindly assume we're
        configuring.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm, debian/lrrd-client.postrm:
      - Better handling of empty dirs after purge.  (This is workaround for
        dpkg bug #198522).

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm:
      - Remove some ucf stuff I had forgotten about.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Updated to the new syntax for passing options to the plugins.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Now only contains overrides to the upstream defaults, instead of being
        a full replacement for upstream's Makefile.config.
      - PLUGSTATE changed from /var/run/lrrd to /var/lib/lrrd/plugin-state, as
        these files should persist after reboots.

      dpkg conffile.  This is made possible by using the new configuration
      setting 'use_default_name'.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Add the system group lrrd as well as a system user, and ensure that all
      data directories are owned and writeble by these.
  * debian/plugins.conf (new):
    - Includes configuration settings for the plugins.
  * debian/lrrd-client.docs (new), debian/lrrd-server.docs (new):

lrrd (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct path to lrrd-nagios in /etc/cron.d/lrrd-server, closes: #202803.

lrrd (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Massive changes in build system, update debian/rules accordingly.
    - The server will now ignore unreachable nodes, and should thus not
      send root arcane error messages anymore, closes: #200487.
  * After reading through the texmf.cnf thread on debian-devel, I realize
    I've forgotten the simplizity and no-nonsense qulities about Debian
    that attracted me in the first place, and that I've fallen for the
    temptation of making the configuration scripts too pretentious and
    loquacious. Therefore, I've killed all of the Debconf questions, and
    instead enable a default set of plugins based on the autoconf and
    suggests routines, closes: #197413.
  * /etc/lrrd/client.conf is now a conffile handled by dpkg.
  * Rewrote lrrd-client's postinst in Perl.
  * Include the APT plugin in the lrrd-client package.  Hence, the
    lrrd-client package now Conflicts and Replaces lrrd-plugin-apt.
    Thanks to James Troup for the suggestion.
  * Declare the debhelper compat level in debian/compat instead of in
    debian/rules.
  * Standards-Version 3.6.0, no changes required.
