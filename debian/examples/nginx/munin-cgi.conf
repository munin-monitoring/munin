## Disable generation of graph and html by munin-cron
## Put this file under /etc/munin/munin-conf.d/

# Graphics files are normally generated on-demand by a CGI process.
# See http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/CgiHowto2 for more
# documentation. Since 2.0, there is no official support for cron running
# munin-graph. It has been rewritten to use the cgi code.
# It is single threaded *by design* now.

# HTML files are normally generated by munin-html, no matter if the
# files are used or not. You can change this to on-demand generation
# by following the instructions in
