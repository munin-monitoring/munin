Munin plugin configuration
==========================

Munin plugins are configured by editing existing or placing new files in
/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/.  Since files in this directory may contain passwords
or other sensitive information, the directory is not world readable.

A plugin configuration file contain one or more sections.  Each section starts
with a label (between '[' and ']'), and contains an optional "user" statement,
an optional "grop" statement, and zero or more lines beginning with "env.":

Example:

 [mailthingie]
  user        mail
  group       adm
  env.logfile /var/log/mail.info

[Label]
-------

A label matching the plugin name starts a new configuration block.

For wildcard plugins requiring similar configuration, the label within [] can
end in a wildcard, like "[ip_*]".

User
----

If munin (or munin-run) is run with root privileges, munin will change user for
the matching plugins to the user specified.

Group
-----

If munin (or munin-run) is run with root privileges, munin will run the plugin
with an additional group specified here.

env.variable
------------

A line 

 "env.logfile /var/log/syslog"

...will run the plugin with an extra environment variable "logfile" with the
content "/var/log/syslog".  A plugin is expected to provide sane default values
for such variables, but such defaults may not exist, or be "sane" on other
platforms.

Debugging
---------

To check if plugin configuration is applied, run munin-run with "-d" to enable
debugging, as root, (like "sudo munin-run -d someplugin") and check the output.

If you do not run the plugin as root, you may not be able to read the plugin
configuration files, and debugging your plugins may be harder than necessary
