=head1 DESCRIPTION

Munin-cron is a part of the package Munin, which is used in combination
with Munin's node.  Munin is a group of programs to gather data from
Munin's nodes, graph them, create html-pages, and optionally warn Nagios
about any off-limit values.

Munin-cron batches all the above tasks by running their respective
programs. All parameters are passed directly to the underlying programs,
so only use parameters that are understood by all the other programs.
