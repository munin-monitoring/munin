=head1 DESCRIPTION

Munin-graph is a part of the package Munin, which is used in combination
with Munin's node.  Munin is a group of programs to gather data from
Munin's nodes, graph them, create html-pages, and optionally warn Nagios
about any off-limit values.

munin-graph does the graphing. It is usually only used from within
munin-cron.  If munin.conf sets "graph_strategy cgi" then munin-graph
does no work, instead munin-html generates references to the graphing
CGI.  Please see http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/CgiHowto for
more information about CGI grpahing.

It checks the rrd-files for updated values, and redraws the graphs if
needed. To force redrawing of graphs (after setup-changes et alia), use
'--nolazy'.
