This option may be specified several times, to add more values.

for configured contacts. See also --force.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Munin-limits is a part of the package Munin, which is used in combination
with Munin's node.  Munin is a group of programs to gather data from
Munin's nodes, graph them, create html-pages, and optionally warn Nagios
about any off-limit values.

Munin-limits checks if any values are above or below the set limits, and saves these notes to a file. This file
is later used by programs like munin-nagios (to warn nagios) and munin-html (to incorporate them in the web
display).

If a service has fields with "warning" or "critical"-options (e.g. "load.warning 10"), and the munin-server
configuration file contains the necessary configuration options, munin-limits will check its value.
