This is Munin
=============

Munin the monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw.
It presents all the information in graphs through a web interface.
Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities.
After completing a installation a high number of monitoring plugins will be
playing with no more effort.

Additional plugins can be easily developed and contributed.
See the `Plugin Gallery <https://gallery.munin-monitoring.org/>`_ for a wide
range of more than a thousand community supported plugins.

Note to contributors
--------------------

By sending us patches, you automatically license the code under the same terms
as Munin.

We also might edit your commits metadata (the comment part) for clarifications,
but we'll leave the diff part intact (except for whitespace edits). So in case
there's a problem with the commit diff, we either commit another patch
thereafter or plainly ask you to rework it. We might eventually squash some of
your commits into one.

Please always rebase your pull requests on a released version tag, one of the
stable branches, or the default branch, ``master``.

If you request a pull against ``master``, your pull will be automatically closed
upon merge. If you request against one of the stable release branches, your pull will be
automatically closed upon the next release.

Information on developing Munin with GitHub, such as how branches are used
and the version numbering scheme, can be found in `Munin's GitHub Wiki`__.
