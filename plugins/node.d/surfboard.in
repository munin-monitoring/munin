=head1 NAME

surfboard - Plugin to monitor surfboard cable modems

=head1 CONFIGURATION

No configuration

=head1 NOTES

motorola surfboard cablemodems (4100 + 4200 from what I know - most
likely more since Motorola uses many of the same settings/chipsets
across cablemodems 

I know this will not work on Toshiba ones (since they use a different
url and page this is real simple - it goes to your cable modems ip,
generally 192.168.100.1 and grabs a html file and parses it. 

I use this to see how good my cable connection. good if you have
choices in your area requires lwp::perl package.

=head1 BUGS

Needs work, some variables used in the plugin should be made into
configuration environment variables.
