=head1 NAME

surfboard - Plugin to monitor surfboard cable modems

=head1 CONFIGURATION

No configuration

=head1 NOTES

This plugin monitors Motorola Surfboard cable modems, models 4100 and
4200. Most likely more models are compatible since Motorola uses many
of the same settings/chipsets across cable modems.

I know this will not work on Toshiba ones since they use a different
url and page.

This is real simple: it goes to your cable modem's IP address,
generally 192.168.100.1, grabs a HTML file, and parses it.

I use this to see how good my cable connection is. Good if you have
choices in your area.

Requires libwww-perl.

=head1 BUGS

Needs work, some variables used in the plugin should be made into
configuration environment variables.
