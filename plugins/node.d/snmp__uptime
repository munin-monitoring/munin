=head1 NAME

snmp__uptime - Munin plugin to retrieve uptime information from a SNMP
device.

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Uptime should be supported by all SNMP devices that support SNMPv2 and
up (If I have understood the MIBs rightly :-)

=head1 CONFIGURATION

As a rule SNMP plugins need site specific configuration.  The default
configuration (shown here) will only work on insecure sites/devices.

   [snmp_*]
        env.version 2
        env.community public

In general SNMP is not very secure at all unless you use SNMP version
3 which supports authentication and privacy (encryption).  But in any
case the community string for your devices should not be "public".

Please see 'perldoc Munin::Plugin::SNMP' for further configuration
information.

=head1 INTERPRETATION

The plugin reports how long the device has been up.  This is not the
same as uptime in percent as used in SLAs.

Actually, this isn't entirely true.  It reports the uptime of the
SNMP agent.  For "embedded" devices such as switches or printers, this
will be the same as uptime, but this may not always be the case for
servers.  (For instance, it would be less if an administrator had manually
restarted the SNMP daemon/service.)

The day and week graphs for uptime are not very interesting - the
year, and perhaps the month graphs are more interesting.  The year
graphs average number will show your devices average uptime the last
year (actually 400 days).

=head1 MIB INFORMATION

This plugin requires support for the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB authored by the
IETF Distributed Management Working Group.  It reports the
contents of the sysUpTimeInstance OID.
