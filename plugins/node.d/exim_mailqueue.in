exim_mailqueue - Plugin to monitor exim queue size

This plugin needs to run as a user that has access to run exiqgrep and
examine the queue directories.  This is done like this for example:

  [exim_*]
    user exim

Configuration parameters for a file in @@CONFDIR@@/plugin-conf.d/
if you need to override the defaults below:

  [exim_mailqueue]
    env.exiqgrep   - Use if exiqgrep is not in $PATH
    env.graphtitle - Title of the graph
    env.queuewarn  - When to warn (of undelivered mails)
    env.queuecrit  - When to crit (of undelivered mails)
    env.frozenwarn - When to warn (of frozen mails)
    env.frozencrit - When to crit (of frozen mails)

=head2 DEFAULT CONFIGURATION

  [exim_mailqueue]
    env.graphtitle Exim Mailqueue
    env.exiqgrep  <autodetected>
    env.queuewarn 100
    env.queuecrit 200
    env.frozenwarn 100
    env.frozencrit 200
