=head1 NAME

postfix_mailqueue - Plugin to monitor postfix mail spools

=head1 ABOUT

A guide to postfix mail queue manageent can be found at
L<http://www.postfix.org/QSHAPE_README.html#queues>

A summary:

=over 4

=item maildrop

Messages that have been submitted via the Postfix sendmail(1) command,
but not yet brought into the main Postfix queue by the pickup(8)
service.

=item hold

Messages placed in the "hold" queue stay there until the administrator
intervenes

=item incoming

Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up by the local
pickup(8) daemon from the maildrop directory.

=item active

Messages that the queue manager has opened for delivery. Only a limited number
of messages is allowed to enter the active queue (leaky bucket strategy, for a
fixed delivery rate).

=item deferred

Mail that could not be delivered upon the first attempt. The queue manager
implements exponential backoff by doubling the time between delivery attempts.

=item corrupt

Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here for inspection.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

By default "postconf -h queue_directory" is used to determine the
spool directory.  Is postconf is not available in the $PATH then
/var/spool/postfix is assumed.  This can be overridden by the
"spooldir" environment variable like so:

 [postfix_mailqueue]
    env.spooldir /var/spool/postfix

=head1 AUTHOR

Unknown.

=head1 LICENSE
