=head1 NAME

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is done through libpq environment variables, for example
PGUSER, PGDATABASE, etc. For more information, see L<Munin::Plugin::Pgsql>.

To monitor a specific database, link to postgres_connections_<databasename>.
To monitor all databases, link to postgres_connections_ALL.
To monitor several instances, link to postgres_<tag>_connections_<databasename|ALL>
The <tag> can be what you want but without "_". It allows you to define several
database configuration.

  [postgres_pg91_*]
  env.PGPORT 5432
