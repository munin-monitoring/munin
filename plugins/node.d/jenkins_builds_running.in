jenkins_builds_running - Plugin to measure number of jenkins builds which are currently running

=head1 AUTHOR

Contributed by Holger Levsen. I wrote and used them first for
https://jenkins.debian.net and very much like to hear about
other users of these plugins! Please do tell me!

Use at your own risk and monitor the ressource usage of the plugins
too - it will vary depending on your setup!

Patches, postcards and pancakes are all very much welcome!
