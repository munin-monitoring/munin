# BUGS:
# - This plugin may fail when the logs are long.  A statefile and log-tail
#   thing would be needed.  See also munin_graph and munin_update.
# - The needed functions are in Munin::Plugin - just port and enjoy
#
# Magic markers (optinal - used by munin-config and some installation
# scripts):
#
#%# family=auto
