=head1 NAME

load - Plugin to monitor the load average on a system.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following environment variables are used by this plugin:

=over 4

=item load_warning <float>

Threshold for when to report a warning

=item load_critical <float>

Threshold for when to report a critical

=back

=head2 EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

 [load]
  env.load_warning 5
  env.load_critical 10

=head1 NOTES

If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on whether we
should be run on this system or not. This is optional, and only used
by munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
always be included.
