=head1 NAME

cpuspeed - Plugin to monitor CPU speed

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Linux systems with a working CPU speed governor/stats kernel module
that can be accessed through the /sys filesystem.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None needed by default.

You can set one environment variable to modify the plugins behaviour:

  [cpuspeed]
     env.scaleto100 1

Show the frequency as a percentage instead of absolute frequency.  If
set the plugin sets up a CDEF to change the speed in Hz to percent.

If you set or unset this the whole time series will be shown in the
same way, either as Hz or percent (as the graphs are updated).

=head1 INTERPRETATION

The plugin shows the average CPU speed in the measurement period as
represented by /sys/devices/system/cpu/*/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state.

This is a counter plugin and represents the average.  Many cpuspeed
plugins reports the "instant" CPU speed at the time the plugin runs.
This is not representative for this metric.

=head1 BUGS

Nah.
