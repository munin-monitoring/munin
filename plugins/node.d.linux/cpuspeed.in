=head1 NAME

cpuspeed - Plugin to monitor CPU speed

=head1 APPLICABLE SYSTEMS

Linux systems with a working CPU speed governor/stats kernel module
that can be accessed through the /sys filesystem.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

None needed by default.

You can set one environment variable to modify the plugins behaviour:

  [cpuspeed]
     env.scaleto100 yes

Show the frequency as a percentage instead of absolute frequency.
If set the "yes" the plugin sets up a CDEF to change the speed in Hz
to percent.

If you set or unset this the whole time series will be shown in the
same way, either as Hz or percent (as the graphs are updated).

=head1 INTERPRETATION

The plugin supports two sources of information.

The optimal source of information is the "acpi-cpufreq" kernel module.
It provides access to the accumulated time a CPU spent in a specific
speed state (see /sys/devices/system/cpu/*/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state).
This value is fine-grained and represents the *average* CPU speed for
every data collection period.
This data is available only for non-Intel CPUs.

An alternative (sub-optimal) source of information is provided by the
"intel_pstate" driver (typically built into a kernel).
This driver delivers only *instant* information about the CPU speed
(at the time of the munin data collection). This is not necessarily
representative for the real CPU speed history.
The "pstate" driver conflicts with "acpi-cpufreq".  Thus hosts with an
Intel CPU are usually stuck with "intel_pstate" as a less optimal
source of frequency information.
