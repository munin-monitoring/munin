=head1 NAME

ip_ - Wildcard-plugin to monitor IP addresses through iptables

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This plugin needs to be run as root for iptables to work.

Additionally you can change the graph title from the ip address to a
hostname by setting hostname in the configuration.

Example configuration follows.  Only the first stanza is needed:

  [ip_*]
    user root

  [ip_192.168.0.1]
    env.hostname host.example.com


=head2 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

This plugin does not use environment variables

=head2 WILDCARD PLUGIN

This is a wildcard plugin.  To monitor traffic to or from an IP
address, link ip_<ipaddress> to this file.

E.g.

  ln -s /usr/share/node/node/plugins-auto/ip_ \
        /etc/munin/node.d/ip_192.0.2.1

...will monitor the IP 192.0.2.1 (you may be using other directories
in your setup).

=head2 IPTABLES

You will need to set up iptables rules to create packet counters for
incoming and outgoing traffic.  The examples here covers how to create
the rules.  Given the multitude of methods used to configure iptables
firewalls, they do not show how to make them survive a reboot.

Please also note that we do not intend to make this script compatible
with anything but these rules made explicitly for the plugin.  If you
use a firewall tool to create iptables rules you may find that that
will not work.  Please add the appropriate lines by hand (or by
hand-made script) if so.

=head3 IPv4

For the IP address "192.0.2.0", you will need the rules:

  iptables -I INPUT -d 192.0.2.1
  iptables -I OUTPUT -s 192.0.2.1

These rules will insert, at the top of the iptables chains INPUT and
OUTPUT one rule which will act as a packet counter.

Since the rule does not include a "-j" argument, it will not
explicitly allow or block anything.

=head3 IPv6

If the IP number in the link contains a ":", it is assumed to be a ip6
IP number and ip6tables are used instead of iptables to read the
counters.  

To create counters you will need to use "ip6tables" instead of
"iptables".

Example for the IPv6 address "2001:db8::1":

 ip6tables -I INPUT -d 2001:db8::1
 ip6tables -I OUTPUT -s 2001:db8::1

=head1 BUGS

None known.

=head1 NOTES

This plugin is based on the if_ plugin.
