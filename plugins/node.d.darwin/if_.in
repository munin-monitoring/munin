=head1 NAME

if_ - Wildcard-plugin to monitor traffic on network interfaces

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 WILDCARD PLUGIN

This is a wildcard plugin.  To monitor an interface, link
if_<interface> to this file. E.g.

  ln -s /usr/share/node/node/plugins-auto/if_ \
        /etc/munin/node.d/if_en0

...will monitor en0.

=head1 NOTES

Any device found in netstat -ib can be monitored. Examples include
en*, fw* and lo (the latter is not monitored by default). 
Please note that aliases cannot be monitored with this plugin.
