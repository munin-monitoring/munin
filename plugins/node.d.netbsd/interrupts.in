#
# Plugin to monitor the number of interrupts and context switches on a system.
#
# Idea and base from Ragnar Wisløff.
#
# Usage: Link or copy into /etc/munin/node.d/
#
# $Log: interrupts.in,v $
# Revision 1.1.1.1  2006/06/04 20:53:57  he
# Import the client version of the Munin system monitoring/graphing
# tool -- project homepage is at http://munin.sourceforge.net/
#
# This package has added support for NetBSD, via a number of new plugin
# scripts where specific steps needs to be taken to collect information.
#
# I also modified the ntp_ plugin script to make it possible to not
# plot the NTP poll delay, leaving just jitter and offset, which IMO
# produces a more telling graph.
#
#
#
# Magic markers (optional - only used by munin-config and some
# installation scripts):
#

#%# capabilities=autoconf
