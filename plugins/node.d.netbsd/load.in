# This package has added support for NetBSD, via a number of new plugin
# scripts where specific steps needs to be taken to collect information.
#
# I also modified the ntp_ plugin script to make it possible to not
# plot the NTP poll delay, leaving just jitter and offset, which IMO
# produces a more telling graph.

# How could this plugin have been written in its simplest form?
# Something like this:
#
# ---------------------
# #!/bin/sh

#
# if [ "$1" = "config" ]; then

# 	echo "graph_title Load average"
#	echo 'graph_args --base 1000 -l 0'
#	echo 'graph_vlabel load'
# 	echo "load.label load"
# 	exit 0
# fi
# echo -n "load.value "
# cut -f1 -d' ' < /proc/loadavg
# ---------------------
#
# Except for the Nagios-warnings (which most people don't have any need
# for) and things used by installation scripts and munin-config (which
# you don't need if you don't plan on submitting your plugin to the
# pacakge), the two versions will work identically.
