# this is public domain copy and share at will
# quick n dirty hack to read specific performance data on HP-UX through
# measureware (perfview)
#
# Sigurd Mytting:
# I wrote some quick and dirty plugins a few years ago who use Measureware
# to gather data, known to work on 11.23, 11.11 and 11, both pa/risc and
# itanium (A-class, N-class, rxwhatever, even the now thrown out superdome
# upgraded from pa/risc to itanium with 64 cores/128GB memory).
#
# Bugs:
# - This plugin lacks "autoconf".  If someone cleans it up to enable use
#   of environment variables for binaries and state files and makes a
#   "autoconf" command it will be suitable for family=auto and autoconf.
