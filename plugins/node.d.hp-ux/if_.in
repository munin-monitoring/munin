# HP-UX wildcard-plugin to fetch in and egress octet mibstats from NICs.
# To add a NIC, symlink if_<NIC> in munin-node's plugins confdir to this file,
# or try running, "munin-node-configure --families contrib --shell|grep if_|sh -"
# to have suggested (viz. configured) NICs linked automatically.
# Then check with e.g. "munin-run if_lan1 config" and "munin-run if_lan1"
# (select trailing "lan[0-9]" according to what "suggest" linked.
# Finally restart munin-node (e.g. /sbin/init.d/munin restart) and run checks from
# Munin server via telnet or netcat.
