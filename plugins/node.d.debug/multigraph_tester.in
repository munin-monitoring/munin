graph_title Root graph of multigraph test
graph_info The root graph is used to click into sub-graph page.  Eventually the root graph should be able to borrow data from the sub graphs in a fairly easy manner.  But not right now.

graph_info The "multigraph protocol keyword allows the plugin to place data anywhere in the host namespace.  The intended use is to be able to produce multiple root graphs and sub-graph spaces, but as you see it needs not have a sub-graph space at all.
