munin-2.0.13, 2013-04-26

-------
Summary
-------

Bugfix & perf release.

- Fixes for munin-async
- Enhanced perf for munin-html
- Relaxed the timeout for munin-node
  2.0.12 fixed the timeout code. But it had a nasty side-effect as the timeout
  setting is shared for global timeout and plugin timout. This version
  decouples both by introducing a new global_timeout munin-node.conf variable
  that defaults to 15 min.

munin-2.0.6, 2012-08-31

-------
Summary
-------

graph cron is the default again. 

This enables simple install either to work out of the box or be upgraded from 1.4.x in a far easier way than with the CGI default.

Only fixes, but many of them.
* fixes for munin-graph (cron + cgi)
* fixes for munin-update
* fixes for links in templates
* fixes for the various security bugs

------------------
Detailed Changelog
------------------

Adrien "ze" Urban:
      templates: fix multiple bad links (mostly with subgroups)
      graph: cosmetics for no-data to graph
      db/graphs: remove duplicate entries
      munin-cgi-graph: fixed memory leak
      doc: nginx - Authentication and group access
      doc: multimaster     contrib: munin-mergedb.pl (tool for multimaster)
      doc: fix missing link to tips/multimaster
      munin-cgi-*: use MUNIN_CONFIG if available
      munin-cgi-html: update timestamp when running for a while

Chen-Yu Tsai:
      update: write node/services with update=no to datafile as well

Diego Elio Petteno:
      snmp__print_pages: fix snmpconf.
      http_loadtime: use bash instead of any sh; `time` is not a standard command
      proc: fix Perl syntax to not use deprecated defined(@array)
      proc: drop autoconf capability and handling code.
      varnish_: remove another deprecated defined(@array)

Holger Levsen:
      munin-cgi-graph: ignore @ARGV to fix CVE-2012-3513 and Debian #684076
      munin-cron: call munin-graph with --cron argument (Closes: D#685343)
      Rename cgi-bin to munin-cgi: the default for the Apache webserver is to
       setup a ScriptAlias for /cgi-bin. The ScriptAlias directive does
       not permit changing sublocations, thus making it impossible to impose
       further restrictions like access controls etc.
       This change was done in munin-cgi-graph, munin-graph, HTMLConfig.pm,
       static/dynazoom.html and static/zoom.js _and_ also needs to be done in
       the distribution specific webserver configuration file.

munin 2.0-alpha2, r3856:4124, 2011-1-19

Commits by bldewolf, feiner.tom, janl, knan, ligne, mha, ssm, steve.schnepp, lupe, jorne

Summary : 

* Huge performance boost
* munin-graph is over, cgi graphing only from now on
* Enabling CGI HTML with an reworked UI
* use a binary DB to store spoolfetch timestamps (fixes growing file bug in 2.0a1)
* documentation cleanup

Enhancements : 

* Better node side timeout error message allowing things to be found out if needed
* Properly label the bgbouncer queries-per-second graph.
* Properly return undef when the SNMP client returns noSuchObject instead of setting an error.
* munin-node: Insert a reset_timeout() call to enable the master to get in a word in edgeways after a slow plugin has executed
* munin-html: Start using fork to save some wall-clock time.  Option --fork us now active and max_html_jobs is recognized by munin-html as the maximum number of paralell processes.
* Actually recognize max_html_jobs as a config parameter
* Add the publication part
* Clean up Perl warnings due to use of undefined variables in two functions in LimitsOld.pm.
* looking at the Net::SNMP doco, -username cannot be '' (it must be between 1 and 32 characters).
* The time of munin-graph is over, cgi from now on
* since pollers are now being respawned if they fall over, the shutdown-spooler signal handlers need to be removed before starting any poller up.
* Cleanup of munin-cgi-graph:
  - Make it log right
  - Make it fast (now <0.1s pr graph on reasonable hardware)
  - Remove $config deep copy, it is too expensive, we need to fix
    expand_specials instead.
  - BUG: Broke --pinpoint processing
* Munin::Master::Utils:
  - Replace some often used REs with string matches for speed.  Helped
    speed up munin-cgi-graph quite a bit.  Introduced munin_dumpconfig
    to help debug the expand_specials issue
  - Introduce munin_find_node_by_fqn to do faster lookups of things
    to graph.
* Munin::Master::GraphOld:
  - Restructure a bit to avoid double loading of $config (in
    cooperation with munin-cgi-graph) and make it possible to pass
    some graphing options (--only-fqn for example) in some new places.
  - Propper logging the right way
  - NOTE: All code relating to host and service filtering and looping
    should be removed soonish - we're only using the FQN to find our
    work now.
* Replacing 'echo -n', which is implementation-defined - with printf, which is posix
* munin-update: Add local URI scheme to enable running async collector directly on the master as this may somehow enable push-to master. Closes #981, thanks to jorne
* ALWAYS dumps the RRD cmd used when an error occurs when RRD::graphing
* Add some extra HTTP Response Headers
* JMX refactoring by Joachim Sauer
* add some external tools to ease a Storable datafile
* Enabled multigraph capabilities for the munin-async-server
* Re-work filtering in linux df plugin to be much more flexible.
* Force lpstat to C locale instead of EN_us.

munin 1.4.3, r3232:3274, 2009-12-30

* linux/diskstats: New multigraph plugin to replace diskstat_ - more
  tidy and more efficient.  Thanks to Michael Renner for the
  deveopment of this and porting to multigraph
* linux/cpuspeed: Specify "average" for the speed, switch to printf to
  get numbers printed in full, E notation looses significant digits
  and there are whispers of a bug in the E notation handling in
  munin-update
* Make munin-update --nofork not die when nodes are unavailable.  Closes #800.
* hddtemp_smartctl: Multiple enhancements: 
  - document how to set type_ for sata drives
  - document need to run as a user with device access
  - Support some debugging
  - detect if smartctl fails
  - detect if no recognized temperature output is present
* lpstat: Warn if the predefined $lpstat executable is not executable,
  Make lpstat path configurable and search for it in likely places if
  it's not set. Patch from Lupe - thanks! Closes #826.
* dhcpd3: Only emit .max if the .max is valid.  Document a bug from
  the trac - adresses but doe not close #829.  Patches for a complete
  fix welcome.
* More specific test for watermark feature (1.2.13 required)
* Make 0755 default permissions for $DBDIR and make consistent in
  Makefile and munin-check

  munin-node-configure reject it.
* linux/yum: Enhance statefile error message.  Update to use M::C::Defaults
* linux/vserver_*: Add autoconfiguration (patch from #811 submitted by
  proppy, closes ticket).
* munin-update: Make true check into defined check to avoid dereferencing undefs
* Munin::Plugin:
  - Better documentation of new default state file name.
  - In need_multigraph, if run from a tty with "config" or no arguments
    advice to use munin-run and exit.
* mailman: User contributed patch to make plugin work better the first
  time. Also replaced "exit $n" with "die" with good error messages.
  Untested but perl says syntax ok.
* hddtemp_smartctl: Added chomp, as it won't work with a newline at
  the end. Thanks to Ingvar Hagelund for pointing this out

* munin-update: Suppress warning "Error reading includedir directory"
  in case the includedir is empty (which is the case in new
  installations. This caused cron to send these messages all the time
* Munin::Master::GraphOld: warn_min/warn_max typo fix


munin 1.4.2, r3167:3231, 2009-12-16

* Munin::Plugin::Pgslq: Clean the fieldnames before returning them, so
  we don't generate invalid data with for example a dash in the
  database name.
* jmx_: Add authentication support, fix exceptions in various memory
  related parts, refactor connection negotiation to one central
  connection class, add default connection info for jmx_, so we
  actually are a bit autoconfy
* munin_update: Update to work correctly with 1.4, document and enhance a bit
* munin_stats: Provide better graph_info and set some warning and
  critical levels at 4 minutes and 4m45s
* Improove colors contrast in jmx plugins which have Max area, to make
  them more readable + fix some indentation
* ntp_offset: make info into graph_info
* Munin-(node|run): Make group name resolution lazy, enhance error
  messages and reinstate the group foo,(bar) syntax
* munin-(node|run): Set umask to 0002 so that state files are group writable

  INSTALLERS: chmod g+w on the files in your state directory
  (/var/opt/munin/plugin-state in a default install)

* multips_memory: New plugin graphing the sum of the memory usage of
  different processes matched by regular expression.
* Perl modules should not have x bit set: Remove on *Old.pm
* munin-update: Make I/O timeout fatal to terminate
  munin-update<->munin-node communication otherwise the two parties
  falls out of phase (or we need to introduce a RESET command or close
  and reopen node connection, but I don't want to do that, esp. not
  now). Handle the fallout of making it fatal.
* linux/load and linux/cpu: Correct warning/critical documentation
* postgres_querylength_: Fix query that can never have worked...
* Switch fonts to DejaVuSans og DejaVuSansMono.  Vera is now obsoleted
  by DejaVu in most contexts.

  INSTALLERS: On platforms with RRD 1.3 the fonts need not be removed
  and no paths need to be installed as long as the DejaVuSans font
  family is installed.

* Reorder somewhat to get lines on top of areas
* Patch from blueyed to make munin-*cgi-graph work
* snmp__if_multi: Only set .max if the interface speed has been obtained

* dhcpd3: re-fix deprecated non-0 exit on autoconf
* add freeradius plugins from Alan DeKok and adapt better for munin-trunk
* linux/df_inode: Small pod correction and add debugfs to df_inode exclude list
* linux/df: Added debugfs to df.in exclude list
* Apache plugins: Exit with proper error of LWP::UserAgent not
  found. This can happen if someone configured the plugin manually, or
  if the plugin is installed when LWP::Useragent is installed and
  passes autoconf, but sometime later LWP::Useragent is
  removed. Without this patch the error message is confusing: Cant
  locate object method "new" via package "LWP::UserAgent" This also
  keeps autoconf output sane even if LWP::Useragent is not available
* linux/ip_: Actually support ipv6.  Munin does actually handle : in
  plugin names right
* make rpm does not work and won't work.  Remove makefile target and
  spec file.  Might be added back later.
* There are no new autoconfiguring plugins in this release.

munin (1.4.1, r3116:3166, 2009-12-04)

* munin-node: Introduce a select loop to read from plugin
  output/errors and avoid locking up
* munin-node: Plugins that time out must not be added to service list
* Looked into making sunos/memory use kstat but that's a hack of more
  than 30 minutes, so document dependence on top instead
* hddtemp_smartctl: make it quiet on systems that lack smartctl
* sunos/iostat plugin now works
* linux/load: Correct documentation on how to set warning levels
* sunos/load: Set more graph_ things, including graph_scale no to
  avoid "milliload"
* Update exim_mailqueue plugin to use exiqgrep instead of exim, closing #780
* sunos/df*: Add handling of /cdrom and /media mount points (ignore them)
* M::M::Utils: Remove the "*BUG*", it is wrong and worrisome
* linux/df*: Reinstate the warning and critical levels. Document how
  to set them.
* munin-graph: Correct ordering problem in command-line.
  AREA|LINE/STACK sequences must not be interrupted by HRULEs and
  such (broke graphing of old cpu plugins)
* munin-graph: warning lines without range endpoint gets better detection.
* linux/df: Reinstate the default filesystem filling limits.  Document how to
    set them.
* linux/if: 
* Munin::Plugin: Support default values for warning and critical levels.
* munin-*cgi-graph: Untaint the whole hostname, not only the first
  occurance of something unholy
* Munin-*cgi-graph: Let "." be legal in hostnames.
* munin-graph: Recognize "max_graph_jobs" in the configuration instead
  of logging errors
* Also add munin_cgi_graph_jobs to the legal keywords
* make tar now produces munin-$VERSION instead of using underline between
* linux/if_: This change prevents the linux if_ plugin, when run as
  non-root, from leaking stderr output from ethtool to the log.
* postfix_mailstats: MUNIN_PLUGSTATE is an environment
  variable. Thanks to pkhamre for reporting this.
* linux/fw_forwarded_local: check for readability with test rather than cat.
* Fixes to Announce-1.4.0


munin (1.4.0, r3033:3115, 2009-11-27)

* Give the docs a once-over and update ChangeLog
* Update plugins.history
* Mention Aleksey Studnev in jmx_ doc
* Merge patch from debian bug http://bugs.debian.org/507069 where
  netstat plugin counts \"active connections rejected because of time
  stamp\" as active connections, because of a lax regex
* amavis plugin: Minor pod fix
* Add snmp__print_(pages|supplies) printer plugins
* jmx_: nitpicks
* Fix #739: Perl error message only appears when there are no plugins
  on any nodes, so check that and LOGCROAK in a helpful way
* munin-update: Change LOGCROAK to WARN for munin includedir missing
  or empty
* Munin-node-configure --snmp: modify host enumeration code so
  hostnames that are passed in aren't indiscriminately converted to
  IPs.  only works with plain hostnames, not CIDR.
* Remove Log::Log4perl TRACE level use since that requires a too new
  Log::Log4perl
* Munin::Plugin::SNMP: Added support for env.timeout for SNMP sessions
* Add and extend the UPGRADING doc
* Remove reliance on the very newest Getopt::Long version, update docs
  accordingly.
* linux/files_: fix slightly odd usage of awk.  the warning and
  critical thresholds are static, so they can just be echoed along
  with the rest of the config.
* Postgres plugins: Correct pod from Munin::Plugins::Pgsql =>
  Munin::Plugin::Pgsql (singular plugin, instead of plural)
* Munin::Plugin::Pgsql: Correct Pgsql.pm plugin configuration
  documentation section
* Correct the generic crontab install command
* Typo fixes in docs

* Munin-node: Provide a different statefile for each master.  Helps
  prevent plugins that rely on their state-file from reporting
  incorrect data when used on a plugin that is polled by multiple
  masters.  It uses the master's IP address, so it won't work if they
  are both behind the same NAT gateway, for example.

  set_state_name() in Munin::Plugin is also modified to behave in a
  similar manner.

  Additionally exports $MUNIN_STATEFILE into each plugin' environment,
  so that all plugins can partake thereof.  Should be useful to
  plugins written in languages other than Perl.

* Update 1.4 documentation
* Munin::Plugin: fix $Munin::Plugin::DEBUG. it wasn't being set
  (lexical variable $DEBUG was being set in its place). change from
  "use vars" to "our" for all the externally-accessible variables, to
  make it clearer what is going on.  + fix indentation
* munin-limits: Check if $children is undef before using it as a array
  reference.  Fixes #762
* snmp__if_multi: Call "need_multigraph" function to avoid working
  under the wrong circumstances
* dhcpd3 plugin: Critical and warning limits added. Some cleanup and
  minor fixes.
* Munin::Plugin: straight port of the multigraph assertion sub from Plugin.sh.
* netbsd/sensors_: according to
  <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/protocol-config>, graph_vtitle
  has been superseded by graph_vlabel.
* a few more tests for Munin::Common::Config.
* linux/fw_(packets|conntrack): check for readability not existence
  bail properly if /proc/net/snmp cannot be opened.
* Fix #758: Enhance and fix error propagation, fix exception handling,
  fix sub-process waiting/reaping, and finaly print old config data
  for failed nodes in a working way (probably worked before, but I
  broke it when I retooled how old_service_configs is read)
* Munin::Master::ProcessManager: Correct the join command, which
  resulted in not printing the firewalled host - now it does :)
* Returning iostst* to family auto, and moving diskstat_ to manual,
  until we have multigraph support added to diskstat leaving diskstat
  in auto without multigraph creates 3 graphs per disk, and on multi
  disk machines this makes the main html quite heavy
* Uncomment includedir /etc/munin/munin-conf.d in munin.conf.in, and
  make sure Makefile creates the directory at install time
* add some tests for Munin::Common::Config.
* Munin::Common::Config: populate the valid keyword hash directly,
  rather than through an intermediate array.
* linux/diskstat_: Remove fake_munin_plugin, as we know we include
  Munin::Plugin , no need to fake it :)
* munin-node.conf: only specify setsid once in the config file
* squid_traffic: hit_kbytes_out needs to be converted to bits, as with
  the other data series.  fixes Munin ticket #761 and Debian bug
  557385 <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=557385>.
  thanks to Samuel Leon <leon36@gmail.com> for the patch.
* Prepare announcement of 1.4.0


munin (1.4.0-beta, r2982:3032, 2009-11-21)

* ejabberd_: Fix some documentation and other problems, move to
  generic plugin directory (not Linux specific software)
* No .t files in the TAGS file!
* munin-update: Make rrd files even if the DS label evaluates to false
  in perl (e.g., foo.label 0)
* bind9: Parse query logs with view information.  Closes #661
* linux/ip_: Avoid matching x.x.x.2 with x.x.x.24.  Fix is "obviously"
  correct and has only been syntax checked
* linux/ip_: Document that we won't support rule matching on the "any"
  firewall framework
* linux/cps_ (LVS) plugin fixed by incurporating patch in #636.  Not
  tested beyond a syntax/autoconf test
* bind9_rndc: Parse BIND 9.6 stats output.
* exim_mailqueue: Add documentation about user required to run plugin and
  modidy AWK script as the default action is to print the whole line, which
  was done...
* Various fixees to various plugins
* sunos/iostat: New plugin showhing I/O thruput on Solaris
* exim_mailstats: count the number of received, rejected and completed
  emails using regexes rather than substr().  fix for ticket #698.
  also suppress stderr when fetching the log_file_path, remove some
  unnecessary code, improve error when the logfile is unreadable, and
  tidy up here and there.
* dev_scripts/install: add install-plugins-prime to the targets run
  during a standard install.  makes working on plugins rather easier,
  since a full, slow, salted-earth reinstall isn't required.
* postfix_mailstats: remove processing of rotated logfiles, as decided
  in ticket #631.  also includes a bit of tidying, and descriptive
  error messages when bailing rather than relying exclusively on exit
  status.  i don't have a postfix server to hand, so this is not
  exactly well tested...
* Plugin execution: remove undefined elements from the plugin command
  passed to exec.  this fixes the underlying problem the yum plugin
  was encountering earlier.
* linux/yum: change yum plugin so it ignores defined-but-empty
  arguments.  makes fetch work again.
* munin-graph: Re-introduce line continuation in the rrdtool graph
  command debug output
* Make munin_graph immune to redundance in graph_order field
* M::M::Config: Enhance a error message to include input line number
* linux/fw_conntrack: Let there be a total.value even if the input is empty
* linux/diskstat_: Document problem with multiple masters
* overview template: Remove COMPARE links as we will not be able to make them
  correct in any reasonable timeframe.  The datastructure we have now does
  not support that O:-)
* munin.conf.pod: Removed the list of example required parameters
  configurations from munin.conf man page, as they are not required
  anymore, instead moved them to the explanation section for each
  parameter, showing the default
* linux/iostat: Changed to manual, as they are replaced by the new
  diskstat_ plugin by Michael Renner
* linux/threads: make a little less racy (and a tiny bit more
  efficient to boot).  it's still not perfect, because even now
  there's a gap between the shell expanding the glob and grep getting
  round to reading the files, but at least it complains less.
* log anything that plugins print to stderr.  also sends a brief
  message back to the server explaining what went wrong.  fix for
  ticket #582.
* munin-graph: Stop trying to copy cdef when aliasing fields in
  graph_order -- 1.2 doesn't do that.
* Changing munin.conf.pod, munin-cron.pod to munin.conf.pod.in
  munin-cron.pod.in. Adjusting Makefile accordingly. Closes #753
* munin-node: Do "next" on weird filenames not "return" so that we
  read all plugin config files
* favicon for all templates. Refactored the finding of the root path
  and css name in the process. Added tests for get_root_path
* modify how nested timeouts are handled, as discussed with janl.
  this fixes the bug whereby a connection to munin-node would be
  unexpectedly terminated if a plugin took more than 10 seconds to
  run, regardless of whether this was allowed by the plugin
  configuration.
* Catch problems if someone forgot a "address <IP>" or "update no" -
  and make it plain in the error message.
* Use_node_name should default to "no". Closes #757
* Clearify munin_set_var_loc error message so we know what value is
  set illegaly
* munin-node: Improve error reporting during startup by sort of
  merging it with _run_service().  move the eval to the very top of
  the event loop so as to avoid interfering with the session timeout.
* linux/fw_conntrack: Now works in 2.6, closes #532, thanks :-)
* Added ejabberd contrib plugin, moved from debian patches

munin (1.4.0-alpha2, r2899:2981, 2009-11-13)

* set obsoleted tomcat_* plugins to family=manual
* smart_ - fix autoconf yes and suggest empty
* openvpn and misc ntp_* plugins: fix some nonzero autoconfs
* mysql_: fix autoconf for missing Cache::Cache
* zimbra_: fix autoconf when missing perl modules
* Fix brokem munin-cgi-graph, which was : missing : --list-images param
  for munin-graph, a missing chomp($file), and a wrong path to the
  generated png. Also fix HTMLOld passing an array ref instead of an array
* a bit more debug output for the node server -- note which node each
  plugin is associated with, and whether it requires multigraph.
* report when plugins are being ignored due to errors when they were
  being configured.  not very detailed, but better than nothing.  also
  delete them from the list of plugins, so they're not included in the list.
* Munin-node:  fix logic in _suggested_links():
  + never return any suggested links when the plugin shouldn't be installed.
  + correctly handle SNMP plugins whose only wildcard parameter is the host.
    (thanks to janl for spotting this was broken.)
* Add proof of concept snort plugins
* snmp__if_multi: Update to acutuall implementation of multigraph and some
  further testing and corrections
* INSTALL: Update w.r.t. support for SNMP v3
* munin.conf: Correct "includedir" example
* postfix_mailqueue: Fix autoconf for the negative case, pretty sure it
  still works for the positive case O:-)
* Fix various autoconf problems with slapd and ifx plugins
* mysql_* plugins: Now obsoleted by new mysql_ plugin.  Set family=manual
* Asterisk_* plugins: None of these support autoconf so remove magicmarker
* HTML: Border on graphs in critical and warning state for nodeview.
  Comparison views (hopefully) to follow
* M::M::Utils: End the pod section with =cut, so that the last line, 
  # vim: syntax=perl ts=8 wont slip into the man page
* M::M::ProcessManager: documentation typo fix
* bind9_rndc: reinstate @@PERL@@ substitution marker, which broke in r2958
* Get the BIND logfile's size before rndc is run, rather than taking a
  guess at where it might have been.  Fix for #746, thanks to guillomovitch
  for the patch.
* Clean up a typo, add use strict, use warnings to all 3 apache_* plugins,
  add an info explanation for apache_accesses
* HTML: munin-serviceview: add column header on 6th column in legend table
* M::M::HTMLOld: removes underscore from top navigation element describing
  the plugin name for the service page emission. you know for the visual
  touch
* HTML: added variable to set the text for the dropdown for each of the
  template emitting functions.
* Refactoring templates into partials (with include) to avod a lot of
  duplication. There is some left. Better look on the legend table for
  service-biew and dropdown with 'other' links with config
  value. Default is 1 at the moment. Makefile adds install steps for
  new partial folder
* M::M::UpdateWorker: Typo--;
* linux/df_inode: vfat doesn't have any inodes either.
* More documentation of plugins
* Graphs: Fix cur: values for .stack and .sum.
* Graphs: ADDNAN in expand_specials cdefs
* Remove .label requirement on .stack fields.
* Changed munin_stats to check for
  $Munin::Common::Defaults::MUNIN_LIBDIR/munin-update existance +
  executable in order to autoconf it as previously it checked for the
  existance of the munin master logs, which did not exist in a clean
  installation. Also added a check + extinfo message in case any of the
  log files are not readable
* Fix copying of subhashes (#%#parent was broken in old version).  Fixed
  various issues in a couple of programs.
* M::M::ProcessManager: clarify what the numbers at the end of the log
  message mean.
* M::P::SNMP: for some reason, Net::SNMP doesn't consider 'No Such
  Object' to be a real error.  Handle better in get_single.
* linux/ip_: Use env.hostname to replace ip-number in graph_title.
* pm3users_ : we can do colour now
* ipmi_sensor_ - fix autoconf for missing ipmitool
* M::M::Config: Handle continued lines (ending in \)
* M::M::GraphOld: Comment out utime call that interferes with rrd's
  --lazy option
* M::M::Node: A missing .label isn't as fatal as all that.  Insert a
  value and supply .extinfo to explain more
* Make the linux/diskstat_ plugin work better w/o root access,
  document a bit better
* Remove obsolete nagios specific munin-limits commands from crontabs all over.
* M::M::Update: Load datafile relative to the configured dbdir, not
  the default dbdir
* squeezebox_: Various enhancements
* M::M::Node: More specific location of the missing label from the config output
* M::M::LimitsOld: Forgot to actually make this into a exporter
  module.  Thanks to Kevin Fenzi for pointing this out
* mysql_ plugin: Update vlabels for concistency
* Give the BIND plugins a graph_category as pointed out in email by Rado Rovny
* Update mysql_ plugin from upstream
* Get rid of munindoc.in from the installation (closes #742)
* INSTALL: More modules, and a section on using CPAN-shell
* Implement dropdown boxes for peers when there are more than
  "dropdownlimit" number of peers. Implemented for all views except
  overview, which is a special kind of, ehm, view. Also removes
  underscores from names for graph peers to clean them up a bit

* Change <img> framing a bit to allow coloured frames (once the templates are updated)
* Add multigraph support to all programs in the munin-suite
* mysql_innodb plugin: The "new way" of detecting InnoDB free space was changed
  in 5.1.24, add a case to compare correctly.
* linux/bonding_err_: it's a counter not a gauge
* Perltidy quite a bit
* Retire fieldname.warn and fieldname.crit.  The documentation has been
  saying .warning and .critical for a number of years.  Mass fix plugins
  accordingly.

  warn/crit/unknown states in the graph-info field.
* Get the HTML templates and CSS validating.
* Updated templates and CSS with stylish new elements, fonts and such.

  old logging to avoid node-installation-dependency-hell.
* Ever more corrections to INSTALL
* Basic modularisation of munin-limits
* Move favicon.ico to templates, some of us need the HTMLDIR to be fully
  re-generatable from the templates directory (in order to be FHS complaint)
* Commented some templates to make them easier to read and understand
* munin.conf: include cgiurl_graph example
* memcached_: New wildcard plugin
* Refactoring of munin-update, munin-node and munin-node-configure
  by Kjell-Mangne Øierud and Matthew Boyle.  Actuall tests for testing
  the programs were added too!
* templates: 
* html templates: The timestamp can't really be ISO8601 with the support
  of portable strftime % formats so remove the T, and cover the
  eventuallity that strftime does not support %z
* Make templates @@ free - less processing - change Makefile and
  M::M::HTMLOld accordingly
* Put INFO and DEBUG statements into the locking code to make it debugable
* Fix bashisms in nutups_.in : function is useless
* Introduced some actuall debugging output to munin-html
* Cleaned up logging in munin-html and M::M::Utils
* munin-master: make getopt::long dependency explicit at build-time
* linux/df*: Ubuntu Karmic uses "none" as device a lot, so handle that
* HACKING.pod: Revert "Note to do 'make build' before trying the install
  script."
* testplugin: Testplugin for various failure modes - developer support
* Node.pm: Sanitise plugin names
* Node.pm: Fix the fieldname sanitiser a bit
* Node.pm: Better error message for empty plugin list (links to wiki)
* If ntp_offset can read no values from ntpq, replace values with 'U'
  to avoid master confusion.
* New plugin for Squeezebox Duo: squeezebox_
* Add plugin for connected PostgreSQL users.
* Cosmetic changes in munin-cron script to make it more failure obvious
  and and clearify the ordering

* Add plugin for Slony (PostgreSQL replication) node lag time
* Add plugins for PostgreSQL scans (squential vs index)
* Support connecting to non-default database in pg plugins
* Support multiple parameters to pg plugins, using colon to separate
  them.
* Document max_graph_jobs and max_cgi_graph_jobs (see also the wiki).
* Made munin-graph paralell (defaulting to 6 forked processes).
  Adapted from 1.2 patch by Kjetil Homme.  Many many thanks!
* check whether javac works before using it, skip java plugins if not
* pgsql: Properly apply filters to config query as well for wildcard plugins,
  so we don't generate lots of nan fields in the graphs.
* munin-html: Do not try to calculate png size, use geometry of the file
  in the filesystem instead.  This will cause a propagation delay -
  image sizes _may_ be wrong, until munin-html runs again.
* munin-graph: set m/a time of png to last modification time of the
  corresponding rrd file (since reverted)
* Adapt patch in #3 to current munin-cgi-graph for non-fastcgi. Closes #3.
  Thanks to blueyed
* Adapt patch in #3 to current munin-cgi-graph to obtain munin-fastcgi-graph
* Install munin-fastcgi-graph
* munin-update and family: Do not accpet hostnames outside [^-A-Za-z0-9].
  Issue helpful error message if someone bumps into this.
* Munin-node-configure: always do "exit 0" even when saying "no" because
  it _is_ a normal exit and we do read the stdout.
  Mass fix of plugins in trunk.
* linux/cpuspeed: Documentation fixes and slight error-message enhancements
* Changed the Max memory for the jmx_ plugins to default to a light color
  (just like apache_processes free slots graph) as currently Max got a dark
  blue color, making it hard to read graphs
* Compile the java files with -target 1.5 and -source 1.5 so they will work
  correctly on sun-java-1.5 and on (without this, when compiled using
  openjdk/sun-1.6-jdk, they refuse to run on 1.5 jre
* New vserver plugins adapted from Debian
* New asterisk plugins adapted from Debian

* Massive PODing of plugins for use with munindoc by Stig Sandbeck Mathisen
  Many thanks!
* New plugin: openvpn.in from debian, and POD it gently
* Added the ability to customize the install location for the jmx java
  library. As most distributions wont want it in the default munin libdir
* munin-node-configure needs pass the list of plugin names through to
  apply_wildcards() too.  part of #718.  thanks to knan for the report.
* Munin-node: Clean up man-pages, and try and standardise common information
  across all three applications.
* Report errors against plugins with inconsistent/unexpected magic markers.
* Java plugins written by FIX.  Adapted for inclusion in munin by Erik
  Bolsø, Tom Feiner and Ilya Kikoin.  THANKS!

  errors (for example missing Crypt::SSLeay).  Patch by Tom Feiner,
  thanks!  Closes Debian #542477 and Munin #710
* ntp_ plugin: Provide error-message in english if plugin invoked
  without recognized hostname in symlink

* linux/sensros_: Fix error when no sensors execuatble is installed.
  Merge from http://bugs.debian.org/491473
* Merge fix for apc_nis.in from http://bugs.debian.org/511781 - The
  config output by the apc_nis plugin includes: line_volt.max 200 Where
  the normal mains voltage is higher (most of the world), this has the
  effect of excluding the quantity from the generated graphs. The value
  should be increased to at least 300.

* linux/iostat: Added stdout/stderr redirection, merge from debian bug
  http://bugs.debian.org/512407

  http://bugs.debian.org/499391
* Fixed typo in Munin::Plugin documentation, merged from debian bug:
  http://bugs.debian.org/495003
* linux/if_*: Added support for msh interfaces
* linux: Changed df.in and df_inode.in to have nagios compatible graph

* linux/iostat_ios: check if $ARGV[0] is defined to avoid "use of
  uninitialized value" warnings. Thanks for the report to nicklock!
  (Ticket #640)
* postfix_mailstats: Don't fall back to a logfile we have already
  determined not to exist. Thanks to Ulrik Haugen (Deb:#532876)!
* freebsd/netstat: Match reset$ instead of reset.  Closes #708 with
  regards to trunk.
* Add "make tags" target to make navigation easier.
* linux/port_: Fix #500 better as suggested by Kolbu.  Thanks!
* linux/if_*: Recognize venet|veth interfaces in suggest code. Thanks to
  "blueyed" for patch! Closes #591
* Patch to allow master side overrides to work much better.  Thanks for
  patch from "mg"!  Closes #588
* plugins/hddtemp_smartctl: Apply autoconf patch from "qha" that only
  autoconfigures the plugin if the first drive is autodetectable - or
  configured.  Thanks!
* linux/cpuspeed: reversed Hz and % in one case,  exclude "cpuidle",
  only graph cpu[0-9]*
* Documentation: mod_expiry => mod_expires
* linux/cpu: As per a mailing list thread, change Linux cpu plugin to
  not set max for any fields because recent kernels are inaccurate to
  the point where a single field can edge just slightly over the
  calculated max if it is using all of the processor time (for example,
  the idle state can trigger this).  Without removing the max, the
  affected fields have gaps, creating confusing graphs.
* Fix some brainos in apc_envunit_ plugin, make it more like autoconf'igurable
* Fix sunos/df* plugins quite a bit
* plugin.sh: Document print_warning better
* Add a generic crontab for the munin user
* Fixed longstanding bug in munin-node-configure which reversed list of
  installed and new wildcard names for wildcard plugins - this has made
  auto-reconfiguration of whildcard plugins impossible, and downright
  dangerous if you used the --remove-also option
* Fix sunos if_ and if_err_ to suggest correct interface names
* Rename sunos if_errcoll_ to if_err_ to get in line with the other
  architectures
* The "setseid" keyword in munin-node.conf should be spelled "setsid" in
  order to be understood by Net::Server.  Since log_file is also set,
  setsid is redundant, but it is now correctly redundant instead of
  just ignored as garbage :)
* Update allow/deny examples in munin-node.conf.in. Net::Server can use
  CIDR if Net::CIDR is installed.  Keep "allow" as default, so as not to
  need additional dependencies on the default install.
* linux/df: make tmpfs'es indexed by mountpoint rather than device.
* Do "list $node" rather than "list $fetchdomain" when collecting node data.
  (closes #699).
* Make ./getversion work on Solaris 10 and other systems with old-style
  /bin/sh (closes #700)
* Remove special_(sum|stack) from allowed keywords list
* Make graph_args --title "Foo bar" work as expected (closes #683)
* Remove depreciated options special_stack and special_sum (replaced by
  stack and sum ages ago)
* Make "make install" behave slightly better and document problem with NFS
* Add varnish_ plugin.  Canonical version is to be found in varnish_ repo
  at all times.
* Detect rejects from postfix/cleanup, and not just rejects from postfix/smtpd
  Thanks to Cedric Knight for patch.
* sendmail_*: Suppress error output from which(1) when the mailstats binary
  is missing.
* Add missing documentation and config file option (see #567).
* munindoc has been left out after r2126, which is wrong.
* Fix bashisms in several plugins thanks to Raphael Geissert for the bug
  and the patch. (Closes Debian bug #530147)

* Fix scope-issue+typo with $STATS
* Use /opt as default target and move Makefile.config-dist to Makefile.config
* Make [plugin] user-name evaluation lazy so that configuration for 
  unused plugins will not cause error messages.
* Added capability negotiation to munin-update
* Added tls README
* Add a general man page hub for munin as requested in bugs.debian.org/517952

  Closes #645.
* linux/sensors: Recognize negative temperatures.  Fix by cnu.  Thanks!
  Closes #647
* http_loadtime uses pipes and mktemp.  Patch by ekohl.  Thanks!
* hddtemp_smartctl: Only check if device is standby for sd? and hd?
  devices (it fails on raid devices).  Patch by anonymous trac user.  Thanks!
* munin-graph: warn -> warning in two places - that will make graphs more
  usefull - we hope - as noted by stevew@purdue.edu
* Fix warn lines where warn is given as range (foo:bar).  Patch by
  stevew@purdue.edu.  Thanks!
* Fix get_[gu]id to correctly recognize numbers and strings.  Patch by
  ligne.  Thanks!
