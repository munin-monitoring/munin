=head1 NAME

munin-sched - A daemon to gather information in cooperation with the main
Munin program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

munin-sched [--options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

munin-sched is a daemon for reporting statistics on system performance.

It doesn't produce these itself, but instead relies on a number of plugins
which are responsible for gathering the data they require, and
describing how this should be graphed.  In fact, it does little more than
fielding requests from the Munin master, running the appropriate plugins,
and returning the output they produce.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item B<< --config <configfile> >>

Use E<lt>fileE<gt> as configuration file. [@@CONFDIR@@/munin-node.conf]

=item B< --[no]paranoia >

Only run plugins owned by root. Check permissions as well. [--noparanoia]

=item B< --help >

View this help message.

=item B< --debug >

View debug messages.  This can be very verbose.
