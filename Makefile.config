# This file specifies where Munin will look for things after you've
# run 'make' in the source directory.  Modify it to suit your needs.

# DESTDIR is meant only for use when making Munin packages.  Unless
# you're doing packaging do NOT set it.
# DESTDIR is empty during building, and optionally set to point to
# a shadow tree during make install.

# Note: There is a need for a VARDIR, with DBDIR, PLUGSTATE, HTMLDIR
# and LOGDIR as subdirectories.  Today, DBDIR contains configured
# domains, as well as PLUGSTATE, and we risk collisions.
