This is a nice OO plugin framework for Python plugins.  There is an
example plugin for watching the number of arp entries on a host.

If the project is provided with install Makefile targets, and a
patches to give the Python module a less generic name than "munin" (in
Perl I would have called it Munin::Plugin::OO) then we can make it an
official part of the project.

Needed is also a Python version of Munin::Plugin.

Please see https://code.launchpad.net/~msiebuhr/+junk/python-munin for
the latest and greatest.
