HOW TO SETUP
------------

1. Directory of the build process
---------------------------------

Create a directory (outside from webserver access)
for the scripts, temporary files and logs of the build process.
Set variable SCRIPTDIR in gallery-build.sh to this PATH
and put all the files and also the directory 'static'
from this directory thereto

2. Webserver DocumentRoot
-------------------------

Create a directory to put the webfiles to.
Set variable HTMLDIR in gallery-build.sh to this PATH.
Create a subdirectory 'distro' therin.
Put the directory 'static' from the subdirectory 'www' into HTMLDIR

So HTMLDIR should initially have this structure:

.
./distro
./static
./static/info.gif
./static/logo-h.png
./static/download.gif
./static/favicon.ico
./static/style-new.css

Setup vhost for the gallery in your webservers configuration.

3. Ownership of webserver files
-------------------------------

If you want to set another ownership for the webserver files
run the build process under user root, and set variable 
WWWUSER and WWWGROUP in gallery-build.sh accordingly.

4. Setup a daily cronjob
------------------------

Place a file with content like this under /etc/cron.d/
