<h2>Welcome to the Munin Plugin Gallery</h2>

<p>This is the place where you can browse description and graph images for our Munin Plugins. 
It is not ready and complete yet. Example graph images are still missing and many plugins lack perldoc sections. 
Help from contributors is welcome :-)</p>

<p>The gallery has two showrooms. One called <a href="/index.html">Core Collection</a> for 
the plugins that we deliver with the distribution of Munin-Node 
and one called <a href="/contrib/index.html">3rd-Party Collection</a> for the plugins from the wild,
that were uploaded to our <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib">Contrib-Repository</a>.
Especially the later needs a lot of documentation work and we are happy if you add info in perldoc format
and representative example graph images to the contrib repo.
The more descriptive content is there, the more helpful the Plugin Gallery will be ~</p>

<p>Have a look at our instructions in the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/PluginGallery">Munin Wiki</a></p>

<p>And now start browsing the plugin collection with a click on the category in the left side menu.</p>
