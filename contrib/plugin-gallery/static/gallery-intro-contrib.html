<h2>Welcome to the Munin Plugin Gallery</h2>

<div class="intro">
	<p>This is the place where you can browse description and graph images for our Munin Plugins.</p>

	<p>The gallery has two showrooms. One called <a href="/index.html">Core Collection</a> for
	the plugins that we deliver with the distribution of Munin-Node
	and one called <a href="/contrib/index.html">3rd-Party Collection</a> for the plugins from the wild,
	that were uploaded to our <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib">Contrib-Repository</a>.</p>

	<p>Start browsing the plugin collection with a click on the categories in left side menu.</p>

	<h3>Increase usability in 3rd-Party Collection</h3>

	<p>Our build script for this gallery collection said today (2018-03-27):</p>

	<pre>
	142 plugins without category were assigned to category 'other'
	341 times created perldoc pages with content
	758 times no perldoc content found
	68 example graph images illustrate the plugin pages
	</pre>

	<p>It is great (!) to have so many plugins, graph images and pages already, but it will need a lot of work
	to fill missing pages and upload images for useful plugins, that are 
	not well presented in the gallery at the time. We will be happy if you help by adding info in perldoc format
	and representative example graph images to the contrib repo.
	The more descriptive content is there, the more helpful the Plugin Gallery will be ~</p>

	<p>Have a look at our instructions in the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/PluginGallery">Munin Wiki</a></p>

	<p>To get a clear and user-friendly overview in the plugin gallery (and on Munin WebGUI), we work on reducing the number of categories.
	Have a look at our list of <a href="http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/reference/graph-category.html#well-known-categories"><em>well-known-categories</em></a>,
        and choose an appropriate category to present your plugin in the gallery.</p>

        <p>Users can always change the category to adapt their personal view by changing the plugins sourcecode 
        before distributing it on their servers or by configuration setting on the Munin masters side (munin.conf).</p>

        <p>Our well-known-category list is a proposal and can be discussed on our 
        <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/munin-users">user mailing list</a>.</p>
