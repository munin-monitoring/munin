Introducing Munin 2.0!

The most important features:

* Even better scalability through:
  - Full CGI integration.  It is for graphing as  well for html, if needed.  It
    is also completely compatible with FastCGI, that only compiles once per run.
  - Binary state data files.  This has enabled a really fast startup and
    storing of state files. Quite useful in munin limits that does need to
    access to the rrd files.
  - Complete integration with rrdcached.  Starting with RRD 1.4, there is an
    update daemon. It enables batched updates, and therefore reduce the IO
    down. Even with 1000+ files to update every 5 min.
  - Large performance improvements on almost all munin's components

* Complete IPv6 integration.
  - The master only require a new perl module (IO::Socket::INET6)
  - The node needs a IPv6-patched Net::Server

* Native SSH transport
  - No need to have a hairy setup anymore.

* Graph Zooming
  - The UI is still raw, but right to the point.

* New look on HTML pages, new graph colours with better contrast

* IRC ( #munin @ OFTC ) has become a real support channel, mostly aimed at trunk.

Availability:

* You can find Munin 2.0 as source tar ball at sourceforge
  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/munin/files/)

* Debian Experimental. Hopefuly in the next stable release

* Expected in EPEL (Extra Packages for (Red Hat) Enterprise Linux) within
  not too long
