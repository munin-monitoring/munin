=head1 NAME

HACKING.pod - contributing to Munin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is the guide for Munin internals contributors (developers,
testers, documenters.)

If you are looking for more information on how to I<use> Munin you
probably want L<http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/Documentation>
instead.

The munin code is marked by years on the battle front. You will
therefore find code that deviates from the guidelines defined
here. However, all new code should be made to comply.


=head1 GETTING STARTED

In the dev_script directory you will find scripts that are meant to be
useful for developing. Most of them are tools for creating and using
munin in a sandbox.

=head2 THE SANDBOX

=over

=item B<install>

To make a clean rebuild of the sandbox

 ./dev_scripts/install 1

To just install the latest changes

 ./dev_scripts/install

=item B<enable/disable tls>

To test TLS, you can enable a paranoid TLS configuration by running:

 ./dev_scripts/enable_tls

And disable it with:

 ./dev_scripts/disable_tls

=item B<start/stop munin-node>

 ./dev_scripts/start_munin-node [munin-node params ...]

And

 ./dev_scripts/stop_munin-node

To do both:

 ./dev_scripts/restart_munin-node [munin-node params ...]


=item B<query_munin_node>

Use this command to query the munin-node directly:

 ./dev_scripts/query_munin_node list

=item B<run>

To run Munin master programs (munin-update, munin-html, munin-cron,
etc) use the run command.

 ./dev_scripts/run CMD [CMD args ...]


=back


=head1 PUNCTUATION VARIABLES

Don't use punctuation variables (see Perl Best Practices page 79.)

 use English qw(-no_match_vars);

We'll add an exception for $_, and $! as they should be fairly widely
recognized.


=head1 FORMATTING

=over 12

=item C<Tabs>

We prefer indentation via tabs. Space-based indentation is usually relying on
editor magic to ease the pain.  That said, nothing should be vertical-aligned.
Only indentated correctly.

When a subblock is started, always use one level.

=item C<Braces>

Braces should go on the same line.

=item C<Wrapping>

Wrapping in code is discouraged. It does not make any sense to force wrap at a
fixed amount of columns. A much better rule is the following (1 stmt/line).

Comments on the other side, are to be wrapped at 78 chars, since they are a
block of text anyway. Any space formatting is encouraged, since it usually
helps. ASCII art is a must ;-)

=item C<1 stmt/line>

Only put 1 statement per line. If the expression is complex, break it in
elementary subexpressions, with meaniful temp vars.

=head1 TESTS AND COVERAGE

Use test-driven devolopment.

In node, server, or common:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build test


=head1 EXCEPTION HANDLING

Currently there is no unified approach to handling exceptions. Use
L<Carp>?

 use Carp;
 croak("Foo happened!");

 confess("Foo happened!"); # With stack trace

Exceptions are caught with an eval:

 eval {
     # Exceptionally scary code
 };
 if ($EVAL_ERROR) {
     # Handle exception
 }



=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The API documentation is embedded as POD in the code.  See L<perlpod>
for more on POD.

More is on L<http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/Documentation>

=head2 WRITING

The POD should be defined all in one place. For plugins you place it at
the top, else at the bottom.
