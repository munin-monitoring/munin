=head1 NAME

Munin::Node::Configure::HostEnumeration - Takes a list of hosts, and returns
the corresponding IPs in dotted-quad form.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  @hosts = ('switch1', 'host1/24', '10.0.0.60/30');
  foreach my $host (expand_hosts(@hosts)) {
      # ...
  }


=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item B<expand_hosts>

  @expanded = expand_hosts(@list);

Takes a list of hosts, and returns the corresponding IPs in dotted-quad form.

Items can be specified as a hostname or dotted-quad IP, either with or
without a netmask.

Currently only IPv4 addresses are supported.
