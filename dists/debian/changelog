munin (1.2.0rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #264878, #293499, #290099:
      - Many plugins have changed type from COUNTER to DERIVE, to avoid
        spurious spikes when the counters are mistakenly assumed to have
        wrapped.  This change may cause empty graphs to occur, take care to
        read README.Debian before upgrading the "munin-node" package!
        Closes: #225623, #233762.
      - Munin-update no longer truncates long field names, closes: #256370.
        This may in some cases cause empty graphs, please read README.Debian
        for more information before upgrading the "munin" package.
      - Replaces the old Nagios-specific integration with a much more generic
        framework for sending alerts to wherever you want.  As a side effect,
        this closes: #291168.

        advertised, closes: #295366, #295367.

        closes: #268142, #268142.
      - Plugin generic/amavis now autodetects how to correctly invoke logtail,
        closes: #284638, #288395.
      - Plugin generic/squid_cache now correctly calculates cache size when
        using multiple cache directories, closes: #288579.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now defaults to reading from a more
        correct log file, closes: #291720.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailstats now correctly identifies the reject
        code as newer Postfix versions logs them, closes: #292110.
      - Plugin generic/postfix_mailvolume now has a improved graph_title (that
        is not the same as the title of generic/postfix_mailstats).
        Closes: #292083.
      - Plugin generic/named now defaults to reading from a more correct log
        file, closes: #291849.
      - Plugin linux/fw_forwarded_local now correctly reports 0 instead of
        NaN in some situations, closes: #284673.
      - Plugin linux/iostat now ingores devices that have had no I/O operations
        whatsoever and thus are assumed to be unused, closes: #267195.
      - New plugin: linux/forks.  Closes: #225638.
      - New plugin: generic/courier_. Closes: #291854.
      - New plugin: generic/perdition. Closes:  #291855.

        Policy Manual.

  * debian/plugins.conf:

        changed to not be world readable, closes: #291226.

        network interface.

  * debian/munin.cron.d, debian/munin.manpages:
      - The new upstream release includes "munin-limits", which supersede
        "munin-nagios".  Update the installed manual pages and cron jobs

munin (0+1.0.0pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, closes: #231049:
      - Project renamed from "LRRD" to "Munin".  Almost every file in the
        debian directory has changed both name and content due to this, and

      - Remove $(<file) bashism, closes: #230116.

  * debian/munin.preinst (new), debian/munin-node.preinst (new):
      - If we're doing an initial install of either of the Munin packages
        on a system with LRRD configuration files and data lying around,
        create the initial Munin configuration and data set based on the
        old files from LRRD.

lrrd (0.9.9r5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
      - Allows for customizing which port to connect to when the server is
        talking to its clients, closes: #214114.
      - Makes it possible to change the plugins' environment arbitrarily,
        sort-of closes: #214277.
      - Relaxes the paranoia regarding the plugins' ownership and permission
        modes somewhat, closes: #214186, #216401.
      - Further impovements to the error-handling logic in lrrd-server, which
        hopefully closes: #215739, #222674, #222821.
      - Removed the spurious use of Config::General in lrrd-client,
        closes: #216176.
      - Includes Andras Korn's psu_ wildcard plugin, which counts the number
        of processes owned by specific users, closes: #214210.  Thanks, Andras!
      - The number of context switches per second is now graphed by the
        interrupts plugin, closes: #222838.  Thanks, Mike Fedyk!
      - Corrected field names in the vmstat plugin, closes: #222841.  Thanks
        again, Mike Fedyk!

  * debian/control:
      - Drop dependency on libconfig-general-perl for lrrd-server, as this
        configuration file format is now deprecated.
      - Change priority to extra, due to the dependency on librrds-perl.

  * debian/rules:
      - Polished slightly.

  * debian/lrrd-client.dirs:
      - Removed unecessary entry /var/run/lrrd, which is installed from the
        Makefile.

  * debian/lrrd-client.init:
      - Rewritten, now sports improved error handling and intrinsic distrust of
        start-stop-daemon's return values, closes: #202190.

  * debian/lrrd-server.cron.d:
      - Check if the binaries we're about to run exist and are executable
        before running them, closes: #221691.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - If we're updating from the packages which didn't create the lrrd system
        group, try to make the GID the same as the already existing lrrd users'
        UID, if it's available.

  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
      - Rewritten as a shell script.
      - Initial plugin setup now relies on lrrd-client-configure instead of an
        internal function to to initialize plugins.  This also ensures that
        automatic plugins later added to the package will be enabled on
        upgrades.
      - The plugins' state files was inappropriately placed in /var/run, move
        them to /var/lib if any exist in the former location.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
      - Actually check how we're called, don't blindly assume we're
        configuring.

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm, debian/lrrd-client.postrm:
      - Better handling of empty dirs after purge.  (This is workaround for
        dpkg bug #198522).

  * debian/lrrd-server.postrm:
      - Remove some ucf stuff I had forgotten about.

  * debian/plugins.conf:
      - Updated to the new syntax for passing options to the plugins.

  * debian/Makefile.config:
      - Now only contains overrides to the upstream defaults, instead of being
        a full replacement for upstream's Makefile.config.
      - PLUGSTATE changed from /var/run/lrrd to /var/lib/lrrd/plugin-state, as
        these files should persist after reboots.

  * debian/Makefile.config, debian/rules:
    - Updated for the new upstream release.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst:
    - Use lrrd-run instead of invoking the plugins directly, to ensure their
      autoconf values are correct.
  * debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Stop using ucf to handle /etc/lrrd/server.conf, instead ship is as a
      dpkg conffile.  This is made possible by using the new configuration
      setting 'use_default_name'.
  * debian/lrrd-client.postinst, debian/lrrd-server.postinst:
    - Add the system group lrrd as well as a system user, and ensure that all
      data directories are owned and writeble by these.
  * debian/plugins.conf (new):
    - Includes configuration settings for the plugins.
  * debian/lrrd-client.docs (new), debian/lrrd-server.docs (new):

lrrd (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct path to lrrd-nagios in /etc/cron.d/lrrd-server, closes: #202803.

lrrd (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Massive changes in build system, update debian/rules accordingly.
    - The server will now ignore unreachable nodes, and should thus not
      send root arcane error messages anymore, closes: #200487.
  * After reading through the texmf.cnf thread on debian-devel, I realize
    I've forgotten the simplizity and no-nonsense qulities about Debian
    that attracted me in the first place, and that I've fallen for the
    temptation of making the configuration scripts too pretentious and
    loquacious. Therefore, I've killed all of the Debconf questions, and
    instead enable a default set of plugins based on the autoconf and
    suggests routines, closes: #197413.
  * /etc/lrrd/client.conf is now a conffile handled by dpkg.
  * Rewrote lrrd-client's postinst in Perl.
  * Include the APT plugin in the lrrd-client package.  Hence, the
    lrrd-client package now Conflicts and Replaces lrrd-plugin-apt.
    Thanks to James Troup for the suggestion.
  * Declare the debhelper compat level in debian/compat instead of in
    debian/rules.
  * Standards-Version 3.6.0, no changes required.
