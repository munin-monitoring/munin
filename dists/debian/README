For Debian packaging trunk/dists/debian is _deprecated_.

A branch for svn-buildpackage has been created at branches/debian,
with subdirectories for each release codename:

svn ls svn://munin-monitoring.org/munin/branches/debian

This works with using released tarballs which are available in 
munin/branches/debian/$codename/tarballs/

For working with munin SVN trunk, the easiest way is to checkout 
squeeze/trunk/debian in the munin trunk directory as debian:

$ svn co http://munin-monitoring.org/svn/munin/trunk/ munin-trunk
$ cd munin-trunk
$ svn co http://munin-monitoring.org/svn/munin/branches/debian/squeeze/trunk/debian/ debian

Now dpkg-buildpackage should work flawlessly, but as this is trunk, it might
not :-)
