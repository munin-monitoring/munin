Munin network-wide graphing framework (node)

Munin is a tool for graphing all sorts of information about one or more
servers and displaying it in a web interface. It uses the excellent
RRDTool (written by Tobi Oetiker) and is written in Perl. Munin has a
master/node architecture. The master connects to all the nodes at regular
intervals, and asks them for data. It then stores the data in RRD-files,
and (if needed) updates the graphs. One of the main goals have been ease
of creating own "plugins" (graphs).

This is the collector. It is installed on the machine that shall collect
and display performance data.
