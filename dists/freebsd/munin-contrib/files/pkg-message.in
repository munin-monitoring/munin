message: <<EOD
To avoid having too many plugins activating at once when this port
is installed, the contributed plugins from this port are NOT installed
in munin's plugins directory.

The best way to use a contributed plugin is to make a symlink to
it to munin's plugins directory, for example:

  ln -s %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/plugins/cyrus/cyrus-imapd %%PREFIX%%/share/munin/plugins/

Note that as this is a "contrib" port, some plugins may need some
dependencies to run that are not provided by this port.
