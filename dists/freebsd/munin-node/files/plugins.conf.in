######################################################################
# This file is installed by the sysutils/munin-node port, you should #
# not change it, you should create a local.conf file in the same     #
# directory with your local changes.                                 #
######################################################################
#
# This file contains configuration options for the plugins. Three
# options are understood by munin-node itself:
#
#   user <user>         # Set the user to run the plugin as
#   group <group>       # Set the group to run the plugin as
#   command <command>   # Run <command> instead of the plugin. %c
#                         expands to what would normally be run.
#   env.<variable>      # Sets <variable> in the plugin's environment, see the
#                         individual plugins to find out which variables they
#                         care about.
#
# Note that many of the environment variables are just guesses
# because the port maintainer did not bother to install all the
# software that the Munin plugins can monitor. Please don't hesitate
# to file a PR against the munin-node port if you find an error.

# The logtail program used by many plugins is installed with the
# port security/logcheck. The munin-node port has no dependency on
# that port because most plugins do not require it.
