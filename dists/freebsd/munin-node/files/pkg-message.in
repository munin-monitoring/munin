Unless this file already existed, a sample configuration file
has been placed in %%ETCDIR%%/munin-node.conf.

Please edit it according to your needs.

The Munin client will *not* be started automatically. To allow it
to start, put this line in /etc/rc.conf:

munin_node_enable="YES"

Then, it will be started on the next boot. If this line is already
present, the client will be started now.  Otherwise, edit
/etc/rc.conf and execute this command:

    %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/munin-node start

For a list of plugins that will probably work run
%%PREFIX%%/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

If this is a fresh install run
%%PREFIX%%/sbin/munin-node-configure --shell | sh -x
to install the plugins automatically

The munin-node newsyslog.conf(5) filename has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/munin-node
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/munin-node.conf

Any file found at the old location has been automatically moved to
the new location. This was done to ensure log rotation continued to
work after change r340318 made to FreeBSD base, where the default
newsyslog configuration now only includes filenames that end with
'.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or
edit this file, you will need to change their configuration to use
the new filename.
