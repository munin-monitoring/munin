Unless this file already existed, a sample configuration file
has been placed in %%ETCDIR%%/munin.conf.

Please edit it according to your needs.

The Munin server will be run from cron under the user 'munin'.

If you need to customize the munin crontab, remove the lines
containing #BEGIN_MUNIN_MAIN and #END_MUNIN_MAIN, and add a line
with #MANUAL_MUNIN_CRONTAB.

The munin-master newsyslog.conf(5) filename has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/munin-master
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/munin-master.conf

Any file found at the old location has been automatically moved to
the new location. This was done to ensure log rotation continued to
work after change r340318 made to FreeBSD base, where the default
newsyslog configuration now only includes filenames that end with
'.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or
edit this file, you will need to change their configuration to use
the new filename.
