Tutorial

Welcome to the Munin Tutorial. The following few chapters are intended to give
a simple introduction to Munin, monitoring concepts, and the Munin protocol to
those who are new to any one of these aspects. We only assume some general
knowledge about how to use computers. No particular Unix or programming
experience is required. This part is mainly intended to give you some hands-on
experience with important aspects of the Munin system. It makes no attempt to
be a complete or thorough treatment of the topics it covers.

After you have worked through this tutorial you might want to move on to
reading :ref:`Part II <protocol-index>` to gain a more formal knowledge of the
Munin protocol, or :ref:`Part IV <api-index>`  for information about developing
applications for Munin. Those who set up and manage their own server should
also read :ref:`Part III <install-index>`.
