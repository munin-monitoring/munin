 nginx configuration
=====================

This example describes how to set up nginx for serving content
generated by  munin.

This document describes two alternative configurations:

1. serving static graphs and HTML generated by munin-cron
2. proxy traffic to munin-httpd


Serving cron-made graphs and HTML
=================================

Nginx is quite good at serving static files, and as such the configuration is
mostly in place already.

The paths are as in use on a Debian Linux system.
Add the following to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default::

    location /munin/static/ {
            alias /etc/munin/static/;
            expires modified +1w;
    }

    location /munin/ {
            auth_basic            "Restricted";
            # Create the htpasswd file with the htpasswd tool.
            auth_basic_user_file  /etc/nginx/htpasswd;

            alias /var/cache/munin/www/;
            expires modified +310s;
    }
   
For Zoom to work you also need to add the following to your configuration    
         
         location ^~ /munin-cgi/munin-cgi-graph/ { 
          access_log off;       
          fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/munin-cgi/munin-cgi-graph)(.*);  
          fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;     
          fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/munin/fcgi-graph.sock;  
          include fastcgi_params;    
       }




If this is a dedicated Munin server, you might want to redirect the front
page as well::

    location / {
            rewrite ^/$ munin/ redirect; break;
    }


Using munin-httpd
=================

You can use `nginx as a proxy`_ in front of munin-httpd.

This enables you to add `transport layer security`_ and
`http authentication`_ (not included in this example).

.. index::
   triple: example; munin-httpd; nginx configuration

::

    location /munin/static/ {
        alias /etc/munin/static/;
    }

    location /munin/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4948/;
    }
