 Using munin plugins
=====================

   pair: plugin; installing

Installing
==========

The default directory for plugin scripts is /usr/share/munin/plugins/.
A plugin is activated when you create a symbolic link in the ``servicedir`` 
(usually /etc/munin/plugins/ for a package installation of Munin)
and restart the munin-node daemon.

The utility :ref:`munin-node-configure` is used by Munin installation 
procedure to check which plugins are suitable for your node and 
create the links automatically. You may call it everytime when you
changed something (services, hardware  or configuration) on your
node and want to adjust the collection of plugins accordingly. 
Wenn you removed software start it with option '--remove-also'.

To use a Munin plugin being delivered from a `3rd-Party <http://gallery.munin-monitoring.org/contrib/>`_,
place it in directory ``/usr/local/munin/lib/plugins`` (or in another 
directory of your choice) make it executable and create the service link. 
It may work also, if you put the plugin in the ``servicedir`` directly, 
but this is not recommended to support use of utility 
``munin-node-configure`` and because it is not appropriate for
:ref:`wildcard plugins <tutorial-plugins-wildcard>` and also
to avoid struggle with SELinux.

You may put 3rd-Party plugins in the *official* plugin directory
(usually ``/usr/share/munin/plugins``), but be prepared (Backup!)
against overwriting existing plugin scripts with newer versions
from the distribution.

   pair: plugin; configuration

.. _plugin-conf.d:

Configuring
===========

plugin-conf.d is the directory with the plugin configuration files. 
When pre-packaged, it's usually located in /etc/munin/, while if 
compiled from source it is often found in /etc/opt/munin/. 

To make sure that you get all new plugin configurations with software updates 
you should not change the file munin-node which is delivered with the munin package.
Instead put your customized configuration in a file called zzz-myconf.
As the config files are read in alphabetical order your file is read 
at last and will override configuration found in the other files.

The file should consist of one or more sections, one section for each 
(group of) plugin(s) that should run with different privileges 
and/or environment variables.

Start a plugins configuration section with the plugins name in square brackets:

[<plugin-name>] 
  The following lines are for <plugin-name>. May include one wildcard ('*') at the start or end of the plugin-name, but not both, and not in the middle.

After that each section can set attributes in the following format, where all attributes are optional. 

user <username|userid>
  Run plugin as this user

  Default: munin

group <groupname|groupid>[, <groupname|groupid>] [...]  
  Run plugin as this group. If group is inside parentheses, the plugin will continue if the group doesn't exist.

  **What does comma separated groups do?** See $EFFECTIVE_GROUP_ID in the `manual page for perlvar <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html>`_

  Default: munin

env.var <variable content>
  Will cause the environment variable <var> to be set to <contents> when running the plugin. 
  More than one env line may exist. See the individual plugins to find out which variables they care about.

  There is no need to quote the variable content.

host_name <host-name> 
  Forces the plugin to be associated with the given host, overriding anything that "plugin config" may say. 

timeout <seconds> 
  Maximum number of seconds before the plugin script should be killed when fetching values. 
  The default is 10 seconds, but some plugins may require more time. 

command <command> 
  Run <command> instad of plugin. %c will be expanded to what would otherwise have been run. E.g. command sudo -u root %c.

.. note::

   When configuring a munin plugin, add the least amount of extra
   privileges needed to run the plugin. For instance, do not run a
   plugin with "user root" to read syslogs, when it may be sufficient
   to set "group adm" instead.

Examples:

.. index::
   triple: example; plugin; configuration

::

  [mysql*]
  user root
  env.mysqlopts --defaults-extra-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf

  [exim_mailqueue]
  group mail, (Debian-exim)

  [exim_mailstats]
  group mail, adm

  [ldap_*]
  env.binddn cn=munin,dc=foo,dc=bar
  env.bindpw secret

  [snmp_*]
  env.community SecretSNMPCommunityString

  [smart_*]               # The following configuration affects 
                          # every plugin called by a service-link starting with smart_
                          # Examples: smart_hda, smart_hdb, smart_sda, smart_sdb
  user root
  group disk

Plugin configuration is optional.

Testing
=======

To test if the plugin works when executed by munin, you can use the
:ref:`munin-run` command.

.. code-block:: bash

   # munin-run myplugin config

   # munin-run myplugin

   # munin-run -d myplugin

Examples:

::

  # munin-run df_abs config
