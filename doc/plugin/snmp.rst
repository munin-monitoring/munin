**Note:** this page talks about "SNMP plugins", but most of the information linked here is applicable to other remote monitoring plugins as well; SNMP is simply the most common transport.

For information about **installing and configuring** remote monitoring plugins, see :ref:`Using SNMP Plugins <tutorial-snmp>`.

For information about **writing** SNMP plugins, see :ref:`Advanced Topics for Plugin Development <advanced-plugin-dev>` for general information about writing remote monitoring plugins, and :ref:`How to write SNMP Plugins <howto-write-snmp-plugins>` for information *specifically* about SNMP, including the use of the ``Munin::Plugin::SNMP`` Perl module.
