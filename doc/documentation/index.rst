===================
 Documenting Munin
===================

This document is rather meta, it explains how to document Munin.

More than one place for docs
=============================

Plugin Docs
  are included in the plugins code files. We use POD [#]_. style format there and deliver a
  command line utility ``munindoc`` to display the info pages about the plugins.
  Call ``munindoc buddyinfo`` to get the documentation for plugin ``buddyinfo``.

  We use this POD sections also in the `Munin Gallery <http://gallery.munin-monitoring.org>`_.
  See our `Wiki page <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/PluginGallery>`_ for instructions
  how to contribute also example images for the gallery.
  
  Have a look at the `munindoc instruction page in our Trac wiki <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munindoc>`_ 
  and edit or add the pod section in the plugins code file accordingly. See the `perlpod Manual <http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html>`_ 
  for help on the syntax. Finally send a patch or a pull request on github 
  to help us improve the plugins documentation.

Unix Manual Pages
  are also part of the distributed munin packages. Most Munin commands 
  (such as munin-run, and munindoc itself) are only documented through the usual Unix man command.

Munin Guide
  The pages you are just viewing ;) We use RST [#]_. format here. If you have a
  GitHub_ account, you can even edit the pages online and send a pull request to
  contribute your work to the official Munin repository.

Munin's Wiki
  Currently it contains a mixture of all sorts of documentation listed above.
  In the future, the wiki_ shall be the place for docs concerning anything *around* Munin,
  whilst the things to say about the *Munin software* shall be placed here in the 
  `Munin Guide`_.
