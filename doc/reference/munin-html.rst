DESCRIPTION
===========

munin-html is one of the munin master components run from the
:ref:`munin-cron` script.

munin-html generates metadata used by :ref:`munin-cgi-html`.

If "html_strategy" is set to "cron", munin-html creates static HTML
pages. If "html_strategy" is set to "cgi", it will not generate pages.

OPTIONS
=======

munin-html has one significant option, which configuration file to
use.

Several other options are recognized and ignored as "compatibility
options", since :ref:`munin-cron` passes all options through to the
underlying components, of which munin-html is one.
