.. _Munin-Exchange:

Munin Exchange
--------------

Was a web platform in the beginning setup and hosted by Linpro (Bjorn Ruberg?).
Later (when?) a Munin supporter re-invented the `Munin Exchange` website to improve its usablity.
When he left the project (when?) it was not possible to maintain the website any longer,
because it was coded in Python with Django and Steve Schnepp said "we clearly lack skills on that".
So it was decided to move all the plugins over to github branch "contrib".

Github is now the official way of contributing 3rd-party plugins.

These are tagged with **family contrib** (see: :option:`--families` in :ref:`munin-node-configure`).

Only if they meet the requirements for `vetted plugins <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/requirements-vetted>`_
they can be included in the core plugins collection (distributed as `official` Munin release
by the Munin developer team). They get tagged with **family auto** then
as all core collection plugins should have the command
:ref:`autoconf <plugin-concise-autoconf>`
implemented.
