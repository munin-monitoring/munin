 munin.conf
============

DESCRIPTION
===========

This is the configuration file for the munin master. It is used by
:ref:`munin-update` and :ref:`munin-limits`

.. note::

        All global directives have to be defined in the first section of the file!
        It will not work if you place them in later sections of the config file.
        We recommend to use the delivered munin.conf file and adapt it to your needs.


.. _master-conf-global-directives:

GLOBAL DIRECTIVES
=================

Global directives affect all munin master components unless specified
otherwise.

.. option:: dbdir <path>

   The directory where munin stores its database files. Default:
   /var/lib/munin

.. option:: logdir <path>

   The directory where munin stores its logfiles. Default:
   /var/log/munin

.. option:: rundir <path>

   Directory for files tracking munin's current running state.
   Default: /var/run/munin

.. option:: tmpldir <path>

   Directories for templates used by :ref:`munin-httpd` to generate
   HTML pages. Default /etc/munin/templates

.. option:: fork <yes|no>

   This directive determines whether :ref:`munin-update` fork when
   gathering information from nodes. Default is "yes".

   If you set it to "no" munin-update will collect data from the nodes
   in sequence. This will take more time, but use less resources. Not
   recommended unless you have only a handful of nodes.

   Affects: :ref:`munin-update`

.. option:: timeout <seconds>

   This directive determines how long :ref:`munin-update` allows a worker to
   fetch data from a single node.  Default is "180".

   Affects: :ref:`munin-update`

.. option:: palette <default|old>

   The palette used by :ref:`munin-httpd` to color the graphs. The
   "default" palette has more colors and better contrast than the
   "old" palette.

.. option:: custom_palette rrggbb rrggbb ...

   The user defined custom palette used by :ref:`munin-httpd` to color
   the graphs. This option overrides the existing palette.  The
   palette must be space-separated 24-bit hex color code.

.. option:: graph_data_size <normal|huge>

   This directive sets the resolution of the RRD files that are
   created by :ref:`munin-update`.

   Default is "normal".

   "huge" saves the complete data with 5 minute resolution for 400
   days.

   Changing this directive has no effect on existing graphs

.. _directive-contact:

.. option:: contact.<contact name>.command <command>

   Define which contact command to run.

.. option:: contact.<contact name>.text <text>

   Text to pipe into the command.

.. option:: contact.<contact name>.max_messages <number>

   Close (and reopen) command after given number of messages. E.g. if set to 1 for an email target,
   Munin sends 1 email for each warning/critical. Useful when relaying messages to external processes
   that may handle a limited number of simultaneous warnings.

.. option:: ssh_command <command>

   The name of the secure shell command to use.  Can be fully
   qualified or looked up in $PATH.

   Defaults to "ssh".

.. option:: ssh_options <options>

   The options for the secure shell command.

   Defaults are "-o ChallengeResponseAuthentication=no -o
   StrictHostKeyChecking=no".  Please adjust this according to your
   desired security level.

   With the defaults, the master will accept and store the node ssh
   host keys with the first connection. If a host ever changes its ssh
   host keys, you will need to manually remove the old host key from
   the ssh known hosts file. (with: ssh-keygen -R <node-hostname>, as
   well as ssh-keygen -R <node-ip-address>)

   You can remove "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" to increase security, but
   you will have to manually manage the known hosts file.  Do so by
   running "ssh <node-hostname>" manually as the munin user, for each
   node, and accept the ssh host keys.

   If you would like the master to accept all node host keys, even
   when they change, use the options "-o
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o
   PreferredAuthentications=publickey".

NODE DEFINITIONS
================

Node definitions can have several types. In all forms, the definition is used to generate the node
name and group for the node, and the following lines define its directives. All following directives
apply to that node until another node definition or EOF.

When defining a nodename it is vital that you use a standard DNS name, as in, one that uses only
"a-z", "-", and ".". While other characters can be used in a DNS name, it is against the RFC, and
Munin uses the other characters as delimiters. If they appear in nodenames, unexpected behavior may
occur.

The simplest node definition defines the section for a new node by simply wrapping the DNS name of
the node in brackets, e.g. ``[machine1.example.com]``. This will add the node *machine1.example.com*
to the group *example.com*.

The next form of definition is used to define the node and group explicitly. It follows the form
``[example.com;machine1.sub.example.com]``. This adds the node *machine1.sub.example.com* to the
group *example.com*. This can be useful if you have machines you want to put together as a group
that are under different domains (as in the given example). This can also solve a problem if your
machine is *example.com*, where having a group of *com* makes little sense.

A deeper hierarchy can be specified by using a list of groups, separated with ";". For example:
``[site1;customer2;production;mail.customer2.example.org]``.


NODE DIRECTIVES
---------------

These are directives that can follow a node definition and will apply
only to that node.

.. option:: address <value>

   Specifies the host name or IP address, with an optional scheme.

   Permitted schemes are "munin://", "ssh://" or "cmd://".  If no
   scheme is specified, the default is "munin://"

   The "ssh://" and "cmd://" schemes take arguments after the URL.
   See :ref:`address-schemes` for examples.

.. option:: port <port number>

   The port number of the node. Ignored if using alternate transport. Undefined by default.

.. option:: local_address <address>

   The local address to connect to the node from. This overrides a group or global directive.

.. option:: use_node_name <yes|no>

   Overrides the name supplied by the node. Allowed values: "yes" and "no". Defaults to "no".

.. option:: contacts <no|contact ...>

   A list of contacts used by munin-limits to report values passing the warning and critical
   thresholds.

   If set to something else than "no", names a list of contacts which should be notified for this
   node. Default is "no".

.. option:: notify_alias <node name>

   Used by :ref:`munin-limits`.

   If set, changes the name by which the node presents itself when warning through munin-limits.

.. option:: ignore_unknown <yes|no>

   If set, ignore any unknown values reported by the node. Allowed values are "yes"
   and "no". Defaults to "no".

   Useful when a node is expected to be off-line frequently.

.. option:: update <yes|no>

   Fetch data from this node with :ref:`munin-update`? Allowed values are "yes" and "no". Defaults
   to "yes".

   If you make a virtual node which borrow data from real nodes for aggregate graphs, set this to
   "no" for that node.

PLUGIN DIRECTIVES
-----------------

These directives follow a node definition and are of the form "plugin.directive <value>".

Using these directives you can override various directives for a plugin, such as its contacts, and
can also be used to create graphs containing data from other plugins.

.. _master-conf-field-directives:

FIELD DIRECTIVES
----------------

These directives follow a node definition and are of the form "plugin.field <value>".

Using these directives you can override values originally set by plugins on the nodes, such as
warning and critical levels or graph names.

.. option:: graph_height <value>

   The graph height for a specific service. Default is 175. Affects:
   :ref:`munin-httpd`.

.. option:: graph_width <value>

   The graph width for a specific service. Default is 400. Affects:
   :ref:`munin-httpd`.

.. option:: warning <value>

   The value at which munin-limits will mark the service as being in a warning state. Value can be a
   single number to specify a limit that must be passed or they can be a comma separated pair of
   numbers defining a valid range of values. Affects: :ref:`munin-limits`.

.. option:: critical <value>

   The value at which munin-limits will mark the service as being in a critical state. Value can be
   a single number to specify a limit that must be passed or they can be a comma separated pair of
   numbers defining a valid range of values Affects: :ref:`munin-limits`.

EXAMPLES
========

Three nodes
-----------

A minimal configuration file, using default settings for everything, and specifying three nodes.

.. code-block:: ini

  [mail.example.com]
  address mail.example.com

  [web.example.com]
  address web.example.com

  [munin.example.com]
  address localhost

Virtual node
------------

A virtual node definition. Disable update, and make a graph consisting of data from other graphs.

.. code-block:: ini

   [example.com;Totals]
   update no
   load.graph_title Total load
   load.sum_load.label load
   load.sum_load.special_stack mail=mail.example.com web=web.example.com munin=munin.example.com

.. _address-schemes:

Address schemes
---------------

The scheme tells munin how to connect to munin nodes.

The munin:// scheme is default, if no scheme is specified. By default,
Munin will connect to the munin node with TCP on port 4949.

The following examples are equivalent:

.. code-block:: ini

   # master: /etc/munin/munin.conf.d/node.example.conf
   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address munin://mail.site2.example.org

   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address munin://mail.site2.example.org:4949

   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address mail.site2.example.org

   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address mail.site2.example.org
   port    4949


To connect to a munin node through a shell command, use the "cmd://"
prefix.

.. code-block:: ini

   # master: /etc/munin/munin.conf.d/node.example.conf
   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address cmd:///usr/bin/munin-async [...]

To connect through ssh, use the "ssh://" prefix.

.. code-block:: ini

   # master: /etc/munin/munin.conf.d/node.example.conf
   [mail.site2.example.org]
   address ssh://bastion.site2.example.org/bin/nc mail.site2.example.org 4949

   [www.site2.example.org]
   address ssh://bastion.site2.example.org/bin/nc www.site2.example.org 4949

.. note::

   When using the ssh\:// transport, you can configure how ssh behaves
   by editing `~munin/.ssh/config`.  See the :ref:`ssh transport
   configuration examples <example-transport-ssh>`.
