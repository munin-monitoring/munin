 Plugin reference
==================

.. index::
   pair: plugin; fields

.. _plugin_attributes_global:

When a plugin is invoked with "config" as (the only) argument it is expected
to output configuration information for the graph it supports.
This output consists of a number of attributes.
They are divided into one set of global attributes and
then one or more set(s) of datasource-specific attributes.
(Things are more complex in the case of :ref:`Multigraph plugins <plugin-multigraphing>` due to their nested hierarchy.)

Global attributes
=================

.. _graph:

:Attribute: **graph**
:Value: yes|no
:Type: optional
:Description: Decides whether to draw the graph.
:See also:
:Default: yes

============

.. _graph_args:

:Attribute: **graph_args**
:Value: string
:Type: optional
:Description: Arguments for the rrd grapher. This is used to control how the generated graph looks, and how values are interpreted or presented.
:See also: rrdgraph_
:Default:

============

.. _graph_category:

:Attribute: **graph_category**
:Value: string (Allowed characters: [a-z0-9-.])
:Type: optional
:Description: 
  | Name of the category used to sort the graphs on the generated index web page.
  | Lower case string as we like a consistent view and want to avoid duplicates.
  | No whitespace as this makes the build of Munin Gallery a lot easier.
:See also: `Well known categories <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/graph_category_list>`_, `Plugin Gallery <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/PluginGallery>`_
:Default: 'other'

============

.. _graph_height:

:Attribute: **graph_height**
:Value: integer (pixel)
:Type: optional
:Description: The height of the graph. Note that this is only the graph's height and not the height of the whole PNG image.
:See also:
:Default: 200

============

.. _graph_info:

:Attribute: **graph_info**
:Value: html text
:Type: optional
:Description: Provides general information on what the graph shows.
:See also:
:Default:

============

.. _graph_order:

:Attribute: **graph_order**
:Value: space separated list of data sources (fieldnames)
:Type: optional
:Description:
  | Ensures that the listed fields are displayed in specified order. Any additional fields are added in the order of appearance after fields appearing on this list. This attribute is useful when STACKing data sources with :ref:`fieldname.draw <fieldname.draw>`.
  |
  | It's also used for :ref:`loaning data <example-plugin-aggregate>` from other data sources (other plugins), which enables Munin to :ref:`create aggregate or other kinds of combined graphs <aggregate-graphs>`.
:See also: `Loaning Data <http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/LoaningData>`_, :ref:`Aggregate Graphs <aggregate-graphs>`
:Default:

============

.. _graph_period:

:Attribute: **graph_period**
:Value: second|minute|hour
:Type: optional
:Description:
  | Controls the time unit munin (actually rrd) uses to calculate the average rates of change. Changing the default "second" to "minute" or "hour" is useful in cases of a low frequency of whatever the plugin is measuring.
  |
  | Changing the graph_period makes sense only when the data type is COUNTER or DERIVE.
  |
  | This does not change the sample interval - it remains per default at 5 minutes.
:See also:
:Default: second

============

.. _graph_printf:

:Attribute: **graph_printf**
:Value: Default format string for data source values.
:Type: optional
:Description:

============

.. _graph_scale:

:Attribute: **graph_scale**
:Value: yes|no

:See also:
:Default: 'yes'

============

.. _graph_title:

:Attribute: **graph_title**
:Value: string
:Type: required
:Description: Sets the title of the graph
:See also:
:Default:

============

.. _graph_total:

:Attribute: **graph_total**
:Value: string
:Type: optional
:Description:
  | If set, summarizes all the data sources' values and reports the results in an extra row in the legend beneath the graph. The value you set here is used as label for that line.
  |
  | Note that, since Munin version 2.1, using the special ``undef`` keyword disables it (to override in munin.conf).
:See also:
:Default:

:Value: string
:Type: optional
:Description:
  | Herewith the plugin tells that it delivers a hierarchy of graphs. The attribute will show up multiple times in the config section, once for each graph that it contains. It announces the name of the graph for which the further configuration attributes then follow.
  |
  | This feature is available since Munin version 1.4.0.
:See also: :ref:`Multigraph plugins <plugin-multigraphing>`
:Default:

============

.. _update:

:Attribute: **update**
:Value: yes | no
:Type: optional
:Description:
  | Decides whether munin-update should fetch data for the graph.
  |
  | Note that the graph will be shown even if updates are disabled and then be blank.
:See also: Set to ``no`` when dealing with :ref:`Graph aggregation <example-plugin-aggregate>` and/or :ref:`loaning data <example-aggregated-stack>`.
:Default: 'yes'

.. _update_rate:

============

.. _plugin_attributes_data:

Data source attributes
======================

.. _notes-on-fieldnames:

Notes on field names
--------------------

Each data source in a plugin must be identified by a field name.

The characters must be ``[a-zA-Z0-9_]``, while the first character must be ``[a-zA-Z_]``.

Reserved keyword(s): A field must not be named ``root``. If it's done `Graph generation would be stopped <http://munin-monitoring.org/ticket/921>`_.

In earlier versions of Munin the fieldname may not exceed 19 characters in length.  Since munin 1.2 this limit has been circumvented.

Field name attributes

=======

This is an example of the plugin fields used with the "df" plugin. The
"munin-run" command is used to run the plugin from the command line.

 graph_title Filesystem usage (in %)
 graph_args --upper-limit 100 -l 0
 graph_vlabel %
 graph_category disk
 graph_info This graph shows disk usage on the machine.
 _dev_hda1.label /
 _dev_hda1.info / (ext3) -> /dev/hda1
 _dev_hda1.warning 92
 _dev_hda1.critical 98
