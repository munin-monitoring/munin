 What is Munin ?
=======================

Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool (:ref:`started in 2002 <history>`) 
that can help analyze resource
trends and *what just happened to kill our performance?* problems. It is
designed to be very plug and play.

A default installation provides a lot of graphs with almost no work.

.. Note:: 
  In Norse mythology Hugin and Munin are the ravens of the god king Odin. They
  flew all over Midgard for him, seeing and remembering, and later telling him.
  *Munin* means *memory* in old Norse.
