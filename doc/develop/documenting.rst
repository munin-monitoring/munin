Plugin Documentation
====================

Plugin documentation is included in each plugin, written using the POD
[#]_ style format

The command line utility :ref:`munindoc` can be used to display the
info pages about the plugins.  Call ``munindoc buddyinfo`` to get the
documentation for plugin ``buddyinfo``.

Have a look at the `munindoc instruction page in our Trac wiki
<http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/munindoc>`_ and edit or add the pod
section in the plugins code file accordingly.

Finally send a patch or a pull request on github to help us improve
the plugins documentation.
